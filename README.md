Save all these 3 files in the same folder.
r3 Raw attendance is the file that I obtained from myattendancetracker.com reporting main class report.
Based on what you saved the file name as, you should rename the block of code at the top of debsoc_attendance.ipynb.
Then click run all cells. (You may have to install pandas, numpy, and matplotlib if the code fails).
You'll get a separate file, r3 final attendance as your final output.

For any doubts, text me at srijanbadhya@gmail.com or artemisrijan@gmail.com
