# Running the PES Debsoc

Hello valued Debsoc core member,

The purpose of this document is to pass on knowledge, to prevent future batches from repeating mistakes, and to make tried-and-tested solutions repeatable.
A lot of these solutions may seem like common knowledge, but I believe it's important that these are pondered and have motivated effort behind their implementation.

- As every coder knows, replacing an existing solution with a different solution, could lead to other problems popping up.
- So every solution I talk about will have reasoning, what it's meant to solve, and its flaws that still persist. As long as you're aware of these reasons, you will be better informed in which system to choose, and will make thoughtful changes.
- I believe that every batch will be able to improve upon existing systems.[^1] Every change should be a step forward, instead of causing old problems to resurface.
[^1]: I haven't yet figured out how exactly I'll add other people's input into this document with their name, but it'll probably be a combination of github pull requests and writing their name before their points. Probably even passing control on.
- An ideal change would patch up existing flaws without opening up the flaws of old systems. However sometimes trade-offs must be made, and I trust you in weighing which flaws are worth handling.

**So who am I, and why care about what I say?**
~~It feels cringe to type this~~
I'm Srijan Badhya, a member of Debate Shenanigans 3.0 (if you still follow that chronological system). I've been a part of around 200 debates with PES Debsoc members across my 4 years. I've been a part of conducting recruitments for 3 batches, and experienced the recruitment for my own batch. I've engaged with dozens of juniors about how they feel in the soc. I've talked to debaters from other colleges about how they believe societies should be run. There are too many people to credit in the making of this book, in fact, they're everyone I've had the honor of meeting across my debate career.
You can contact me at srijanbadhya@gmail.com or artemisrijan@gmail.com, I'll definitely reply within a week. 
There already exists a globally famous document, [How to Start a Debate Society](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xm1_dZz6VS4Kio9N6Xo82HoAT-vVU__I/view?usp=drive_link). I felt that it was necessary to have something more tailored to PES, tailored to the state of the PES Debsoc at the moment, and hence I started this project.

<br>
<br>

==This document is long and I don't want you to give up halfway, so this will be the format of the content:==
In true debate fashion, this handbook will have my claims about what to follow, and what to keep in mind for decisions. 
- If you believe in the claim and decide to implement it, you can skip the reasons and move on. **(try to skip as many bullet points as you can so that you don't lose the will to read this document)**
- If you disagree instead, I implore you to read the reasoning behind the claim. If you're able to take down these reasons with a better claim, a better system, or outweigh them, then you should go ahead with this better claim. 

It does take effort to keep implementing these policies, and I want to be able to convince you that implementing something instead of nothing at all is worth the effort.
I don't want mistakes from the past to repeat because I wasn't able to empower my juniors with working systems.
I believe it's good to keep in mind the merits and demerits of alternate policies while implementing a particular policy.


The claims will be in **bold**, and the reasons will be in white bullet points. But first let me talk about the guiding values which are the basis for all the claims here (what we prioritized in our decisions).
Alternate systems conceptualized or once followed will be in _italics_.

  ## The point of a Debate Club
_aka Guiding Principles_

<br>
<br>

2 parts: Debate, and Club

_There have been people who say that the point of a debate club is to debate, and it's bad if you're chilling too much_
I believe chilling is fine if it assists in the direction of the purpose of the club.

The single biggest purpose of a club is to ==provide value to every single member.==


Why do people want to join a club?

- They believe the activity would be enjoyable
- They believe they'll learn something from the activity
- They believe they'll be able to hang out with fun nice people.

I will henceforth link all my arguments to these impacts of joy, growth, and community.
I believe a club should not stray away from meeting these 3 needs of its members. 
The needs are heavily disagreed upon, and the methods even more so. 



_**Many have believed that the point of the debate club is to win tournaments and get accolades.**_

- _This does initially make sense since our tournament results are what our PES management sees._
- _And the debsoc cares about getting funded by PES because that's how we get to go to more fun tournaments._

**However, some of us believe that if you judge the club solely by its tournament wins, you may lose sight of what matters, and a number of unhealthy behaviors can creep in.**

- To win tournaments, you might start prioritizing your attention to the people who already show potential and debate skills, to hone them further.
- This could also mean that when you have limited tournament slots or resources, you give them to people already performing well.
- A hierarchy forms and people don't feel like valued members when they're not the ones bringing in the accolades. 
- When a good debater becomes problematic, you're willing to let it slide because they're 'valuable to the soc'.
  + They may continue ruining the debate club experience for everyone else, while still bringing in tournament wins.
  + By utilitarian metrics, this reduces the number of people who enjoy debate, enjoy the club, and hence reduces the breadth and depth of the value given by the club.
- You might get depressed over the Debsoc 'deteriorating' when the people are actually doing fine.
- You might be cringe and hesitate to work with other societies and give good feedback because they're 'rival societies' who are 'taking away your wins'.

**Most of the benefits are accessible even when you don't solely care about tournament wins. You can still achieve joy, growth, and community without grinding solely for tournament wins.**

- In the 2020-2023 timeframe, the PES management still freely provided reimbursement for tourneys, regardless of the lack of breaks we had in quite a few tourneys. **PES seems to fund us to support activity in the club, more than 'bringing PES name and fame', which they enjoy as a side effect, not the main purpose.**
- A bit of extra seriousness might lead to better 'results', but this can significantly take away from joy and community, so be careful what extent you're doing it to.
  + **Debating should not feel like studying. People shouldn't feel guilty for not putting in the work. People shouldn't be so turned off by the concept of having to output results that they don't enjoy the activity itself.** 

_Some people believe that even having 3 members is enough as long as they're constantly debating and grinding. (The debsoc did reach this point in 2021.)_ 
Some of us believe that being more chill and having more people for fun, is worth it, even if it slows our improvement in debating. 

- A big reason people engage with the debate club is for community, for their friends, for fun with them, so I believe that people enjoying their chill time goes a long way in motivating them to debate more. 
- So this isn't as mutually exclusive as it seems, I believe that sacrificing chillness for grinding is worse than sacrificing grinding for chillness, because the chillness and fun motivates people to come to debates and grow anyway. 
- I don't think you should worry about being too chill and lenient, because being hardcore and strict tends to cause a worse effect in debaters (but more on that later).


<br>
<br>




So if not tournament wins, what metric _do_ you judge the club by?
I personally would try to say don't judge the club at all. 

- Metrics are useful to judge a club to see whether the systemic change you implemented had any positive effect or not.
- However, unfortunately, Debsoc is not like a machine learning model where you can instantly see the result of one tweak, or even see it clearly. A million different factors affect everything, and the only way to retrospectively decide whether a change was good or bad, is if you can somehow derive that the change directly caused certain impacts.
- Else you can also ask people how they felt about a certain change, and take this feeling as a metric. The priority is the happiness of the members.
- _Common metrics people often take, are tournament wins, or number of active members, or number of active members in sessions, etc._
- Unfortunately even the result from such a metric can be misleading. Just because you have less members this year than last year doesn't mean you were shit at running the club (but more on that later).
- 'How skilled juniors are' shouldn't be the metric of whether you are a good mentor, because everyone has different starting points. It's about whether they're getting better. It's about whether they feel happy in this club.
- If you do _have_ to take metrics, try to somehow link them to the joy, growth, and interpersonal well-being of the members.

 
  

# Recruitments
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Recruitment Concepts
  
The single most important activity of a club.

The single place (besides arguably PESDT) where systems matter the most, because you have an enormous scaled up load to handle.

First, a brief view on how recruitments were done in the past:
_For my batch (2021, but recruitments ended up happening in the January of 2022), we had one online round with a quick 1v1 debate, since this was the covid era. 3+1 minute speeches with one witness, and once the debate ended, we had no contact._
_For my first juniors, we had a similar format but offline._ 

Here we naturally arrive at the big question of inclusivity.

How do you handle the trade-off between being inclusive/selective?


Pros of being selective:
- A few PES clubs (like ECell), try to be extremely selective with their members. This generates hype over being a 'member of ECell'.
- People believe that less members means less dilution and you can focus more.
- It's way easier to deny entry to someone than it is to kick them out later.
- You want to have people who actually care about debate so that you don't feel the emptiness of 100 members on a groupchat but nobody responding.
- People feel comfortable to text their thoughts on the groupchat when they actually know the people, not when half of the people are people they have ever seen.
- Eventually small clubs will have more club loyalty than big clubs, especially when in a big club you have random people reading group chats for entertainment, and passing on rumors about seniors to the point where it becomes damaging.

<br>
However, since 2023, the debsoc, with the idea of Harsha, found a way increase selectivity while being inclusive.
The first round remained the same. 

_The second round was a 'group discussion', with one moderator and 6 recruits. And the one who scored more 'points' would be the one who engaged more._
And the third round was a month long, with sessions everyday, and people who attended the most sessions would be recruited.

In 2024, we got rid of the group discussion round and replaced it with an AP round. I think the 2024 model is the best model we've had so far, and I'll come to it later. 

I'll come to the group discussion part later, but **the month-long recruitment was extremely useful** for a few reasons:

- Since it wasn't confined to a particular few days, people could come according to the flexibility of their schedule. 
- People could get a feel of debate before they committed.
- People self filtered themselves out, so by the end people who were consistent were people who were genuinely interested.
- Glaring issues could pop up and we could be aware of problematic people before taking them into the club.
- Recruits would form bonds and some amount of loyalty would be built up, reducing the chances of them leaking info from the group later as backstabbing.
- This was the best way to measure if someone could be an asset to the club in the future; if they would participate enthusiastically and be able to set aside time for debsoc.

(Having a round 1 and a round 2 before this month long recruitment is still useful because
- People filter themselves out after round 1 and round 2, and you'll have less data to handle in round 3.
- + Handling data consistently and accurately in recruitments is extremely challenging, since the more names you have, the time taken to perform all operations like searching, marking, and copying increases, and the chance for names to slip by increases.)

This level of selectivity captured the most benefits, and I believe that aiming to be more selective gives diminishing marginal benefits and leads to more harms.

Which takes us to, **why we should extremely push for inclusivity**:

When you see 240ish people on the recruitments group, you might be intimidated by how to run such a massive club (the way we were). However, the pattern I've seen across the years is that 20% of people don't even show up for round 1 and 50% of people don't show up for round 3.
And even among those who get recruited, 80% of people stop coming to sessions by the time second year begins.


### Depth wise inclusivity
So the reasons for being inclusive regardless of 'skill' are:

- If you're going to be left with 10% of X, try to maximize X.
- The debsoc aims to provide value to people, and the more people you provide value to, the more you're doing for the club.
- The point is not to filter based on skill, but to take everyone who is interested, and help them pursue this interest. 
- Skilled debaters aren't our only assets. Our assets are people who participate and contribute to the activity of the club. People who enable debates to happen, APs and even BPs to happen by just being there. Every person is precious. Without people there is no debate. Without people there is no soc.
- In feedback forms people have been very appreciative of our inclusivity and flexibility, which makes them feel cared for.
- Debate is a weird activity where love can grow over time, and everyone has potential to be lukewarm at first but grow love for it later (I took 3 years to like debating).

So there isn't much clear benefit of having a harsh filter. A loose filter works good enough. To a large extent, it's better to start with more people than less.

Taking a few points out of Nikhil's recruitment document:
- "Even in the ‘worst case’ - if a participant still does not show any significant improvement debate-wise, if the person has put in the effort and work to show up for the sessions consistently, they deserve a place in the society for the following reasons:
- + Improvement is usually imminent. People improve at different rates; some people are slow learners (including myself), and some people struggle with other things outside their control. But the fact that these people are consistent is a good indicator of their work ethic and willingness to learn.
- + On a principle level, we cannot dissuade people from being members of the society except for equity reasons. The only absolute metric that a person can be judged by is their consistency and effort into the activity, and regardless of ability, these traits must be appreciated."


Now talking about inclusivity with respect to flexibility of slots:
### Breadth wise inclusivity
- We usually conduct round 1 across 3 days, so that people can come on any day according to their flexibility.
- But when you scale it up to 250ish recruits, 100 have a chance of being available 2 out of the 3 days, 120 have a chance of being available 1 out of 3 days, and there are usually 30ish people unable to make it on one out of these 3 particular days. Even if something is just 10% likely, when you take a sample of 100 people, you get 10 people this event happens to.
- We get swamped with requests from these people who were sick, or out of town, and care enough to text us because they want to join the club.
- + However you cannot measure this texting as the only indication of interest to join the club, because there are people who would like to express interest, who are unaware that they can text the clubheads and beg to join this way.
- Criticism of 'being too inclusive' goes along the lines of recruits becoming lazy and apathetic if they see a club 'desperately' going out of their way to pull in people.
- I however staunchly believe that inclusivity should be maximized if you have the bandwidth to accomodate these people.
- I took this to the extreme, and since I had free bandwidth in my 4th year, I would go to first year classrooms even 2 weeks after official round 1 recruitments to conduct unofficial recruitments. I don't recommend going this extreme without having the bandwidth.
- There are always people who are unaware of debsoc because our marketing didn't reach them, and want to join only after their friends who have completed round 1, tell them about it. 
- New people show up for round 2 all the time, and I believe that we should accommodate them by conducting their round 2 and then a round 1 for them later.
- I believe that everyone the debsoc can possibly reach, should be reached.
- + Even if these people don't appear serious enough, or end up dropping out soon, every recruit provides value in a debate for the time they are in the club, for the initial debates they participate in.
- One issue is that extending recruitments like this can cause transparency issues, when you try to pressure people to come saying, "Last day guys!", and proceed to accommodate people who needed it after that. 
- + The way we sneakily side-stepped this last year was by saying, "Thursday is the last day for official recruitments", and then on Friday saying, "anyone who still wants to get recruited needs to dm one of the club heads".


The drastic drop of people across recruitments and even beyond is unavoidable and happens every year. Don't beat yourself up over it, it's normal. You will feel frustrated about all the time and effort you put for these people, but remember:
- **Even if people are temporary, they still contributed to the activity of the club for the time that they were there, and that's enough.**
- You did your part, you provided value to them, and your effort contributed towards the vision of the Debsoc.
- Every bit that you did, made you slightly better at debating, slightly better at organizing, and more knowledgeable of how people management works.


### The 2024 model
Further developments from the 2023 model designed in 2024 by Nikhil:

I'll just quote from Nikhil's document here. 

 - Round 1 now has 2 speeches of 4 minutes each from each person (like a half BP, no POIs).
 - 10 minute prep time.
 - + There is an increase in prep time from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. A lot of new debaters are intimidated by the process and struggle to kickstart idea generation, let alone structure and reasoning for the arguments. I personally was confused by the motion wording and felt a general sense of panic given the limited prep time during my round 1. An additional 5 minutes would help participants calm down, giving them enough leeway to structure their arguments and be ready to present them. 10 minutes is long enough to generate the level of arguments expected in round 1 but short enough to handle the scale of multiple people in a day.
 - After the speeches, the moderator asks questions to clarify logical gaps that the speakers may have missed in their speeches, giving them a chance to clarify themselves in a conversational manner.
 - The moderator later asks them retrospective questions on what they could have done better and how they would have argued for the other side.
 - + Previously, the moderator used to be passive in adjudicating the debate. Participants would leave after the speeches, and the moderator would note their inputs. In the new system, the moderator becomes more involved and 2 "enters the debate," interacting with the speakers and questioning them about various aspects of the debate. Here are a few reasons for this change:
 - + + Without 'active moderation', there is a feeling of mystery and anxiety after the speeches are over. The moderator passively tracks the debate, and participants are unsure about the metrics they are being judged on.
 - + + Most participants may have an intuitive understanding of the case, but it might not have come out in the speeches due to the new format and general anxiety of a recruitment round. The questions by the moderators are meant to allow speakers to explain themselves in a more conversational manner while allowing them to retrospectively analyze their case. The questions are aimed at understanding how well a participant responds to an issue in the debate that the moderator has pointed out.
 - + + From the participant's point of view, they feel that the process is more personal and feels like an interview of sorts. The questions assess them over multiple metrics, and they are also able to understand their performances better in retrospect.
 - + + In practice, this conversation is usually fun and leaves the freshers with the impression of, "Wow these seniors are so cool, nice and fun!" (as per what we've seen in the feedback form). This interaction is where freshers usually have fun, and this makes them want to keep coming back.
 - Example questions moderators could ask:
 - + "You mentioned point X and explained how that leads to impact Y. Could you provide more reasons how X leads to Y? Is X the only reason Y happens?"
 - + "Regarding point X brought out by the other speaker, you responded by saying Y. Do you think this effectively countered point X? How could you have responded better?"
 - + "What do you think was the most important impact you were trying to convey in your speech? Why do you think that is the most important issue in the debate?"
 - + "If there was a point you could have elaborated on more, what would that have been, and what new angles would you have added?"
 - + "Is there something you think the opposite speaker missed that you predicted they would say?"
 

I think these changes by Nikhil were absolutely goated, made the recruitment process so much more fun and engaging for both the moderators and recruits.
- Avoid letting the question session go on too long if you have a queue of participants waiting for their turn.






explain why no pois.

Scoring is not important.

Major benefit of self filtration and rounds is that 60% of the people drop out in round 1 and 2, so you're better able to handle the people who are left in round 3. You have better expectations of how many will show up.



people talk about selective being good because, "people will feel good when they struggled and made it to the soc and others didn't". This is bullshit. A bunch of people are bound to dip out on their own anyway.

inclusivity is great. false negative is way more costly than false positive.   

Avoid disclosing the exact number of sessions the cutoff was, because people might think that that is the expectation for them, and be dissuaded from attending many.

We often do this weird thing where we don't make them feel safe and like, "they've already debated enough to be in", because we don't want them to be lazy and stop showing up, but I don't think it's good to give them anxiety either and psych them later.
We play around with them
  

make sure everyone is on the same page with respect to recruitments, last year we had a few random people suddenly change the format last minute.



## Recruitment Logistics

Talk about how we thought about handling the load by having slots. But this is way too complicated and didn't work out, so the best way is actually to make careful polls, and if one day has a super high load, encourage people from that day to come on a low load day. 

Talk about how system, data filling errors are so common, regardless of how careful you think you are

  code word stuff in round 2, people talk about their teammates, they don't remember names, etc etc.

Even the current system was not perfect, we missed out on phone numbers during attendance, and some wrong people were added because sometimes we relied on only WhatsApp numbers names that they put, and messed up with the people who put names like ~.

And even I messed up by adding the wrong people multiple times. System errors are real.

  
basement seminar hall hard to find and easy to confuse, also remember to specify rr campus vs ec campus

Absolutely never input directly into excel, very easy to mess up, when you start inputting data after scrolling far right, you'll miss the person's name and input data into someone else's name entirely, it's very easy for people to put data in the wrong pages, annoying to create a page for everyday and maintain it because people might not click the new page and may just fill the page that opens up to them.

Your organizing team will have flawed incapable actors, who don't use excel properly, find a way to minimize their fuckups (like google forms with compulsory questions)

  
  

Why no win loss announcing in round 2

  

Also it's important to alleviate anxiety, and make people associate good feelings with the soc. Make it very very clear that there's no winner and loser

  

Explain the 3 motions, don't let teams be clueless, it's fine if you're giving them information.

  

motion ranking good because of illusion of agency

  

make sure case prep is balanced, and make sure it isn't one person talking over 2 other shy people.

  

Keeping friends together in debates. Some people don't keep them together to encourage socialization with new people. I think it's also good to keep them together to increase the fun they have in debate. However what's bad is keeping 2 friends and one stranger in a team which will alienate the stranger.

  

General comments about each speaker are nice, but they're too much work for an organizer who is going through around 12 people per day. Better in round 1 than round 2.

  
  
  
  
  

Lateral entry people are very important, make sure they know they're allowed, and also helps a lot to keep sessions alive during downtime

  
  
  
  
  

# Inside a session
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
  
Many factors go into ensuring the quality of experience of a debate session.
Debate is an extreme sport, and half the people are going to feel sad at the end of a session. Sadness cannot be avoided, only minimized.

Debate is a weird sport. I believe that it takes quite a while to get a feel for debate before you fall in love with it for what it is. So, hooking in people to come for the initial sessions in the short term, to push them towards the love point is crucial.
For this purpose, I think it's justified to paint an incomplete picture of debate and slowly nurture people before you hit them with the brutality.

What I mean by this is:
- not dropping finance and IR motions in the early days.
- Even within other subjects, giving easy and accessible motions (and motions they would find fun). Feeling hopeless and having nothing to say before a speech is quite depressing. 
- Although we know that nearly all motions are balanced, freshers often think most motions are unbalanced. Give them easy motions which even they will think are balanced.
- Unfortunately philosophy motions are usually fun, but usually follow the format of, "THW use this amazing technology", and feel unbalanced for opp because:
- + Freshers feel lost thinking of an opp case cuz the benefits look great and they don't know how to outweigh.
- + beginners don't think about regulation, mismanagement, and long term consequences.
- + so even if there is tremendous learning potential after the round, people can feel depressed during the round.
- not being brutally honest and telling speakers their speeches were shit in the early days.
- spending extra time and effort in the early days compared to later days with aftercare
- being generous with prep time so that they build their confidence and lessen their anxiety. We don't need to make them tournament-ready until later.

If you're reading this, you would have already faced the grueling learning curve of being humbled over and over. I believe that if the extremely challenging parts of the learning curve are exposed to people too early, they wouldn't have the love-fueled commitment to persevere through the hardship.
- Sure, the counter to this is that exposing people to the hardest side will quickly filter out the toughest people who are likely to be loyal.
- + However, from personal experience, I and a few other people would have quit debating early if we felt like we were inherently too dumb for this shit. So try to effectively balance humbling, learning, and happiness, to keep them coming until they're ready to face hard mode.


### Time
From the feedback forms and personal experience, the single biggest deterrent of attending debate sessions is time. 

Having to sit idle before a debate starts significantly impacts the quality of experience of the session for a junior. The delay stretches in their head and contributes to a belief of debate being a waste of time. 
Multiple different delays add up, and they should be minimized.
- In 2023 very often that juniors would show up before seniors, and this is extremely optically bad for seniors to look 'unserious'.
- making 1 person wait for 5 more people to show up before starting AP prep is a massive delay for the first person, even if they consent when asked, "Are you okay waiting a bit for 5 people?"
- In 2023, after juniors had shown up, the seniors would still take quite some time to choose a suitable motion for juniors.

The obvious solutions to this are:
1. Do whatever it takes to show up as early as possible, or have someone there.
2. **Start prep time even when you have only 2 or 3 people, even if you expect more people to come. This is okay because**
 + You can't always rely on the people who voted to arrive, and this would result in waiting unnecessarily for nobody.
+ Having extra prep time isn't much of a harm, at least people don't feel like they're sitting idle, they're doing all they can to come up with a case.
+ You can inform the juniors that they will be ironing, and can replace slots with people when they show up.
 + People who come early deserve to get the extra prep time, maybe this will incentivize latecomers to also put extra effort.
 + You can choose to either shorten the total prep time, or have the initial prep time as bonus, depending on how late it's already gotten.
3. **Have a list of motions made in your free time before the session, so that you're not actively wasting time during the session.**

Here are the motions I used in 2024-2025. They were curated to fit the motion criteria talked about earlier. 



before every debate have a short speech where you say verdict doesn't matter

  

Sprinkle in stuff like Harry Potter motions, PES motions (carefully), sugar daddy motions

drop list of tried and tested motions here.
Also include the high table discussion on motions.

  
  It's fine to give extra prep time, starting sessions early is of utmost importance. So don't let them sit idle, give earlycomers the privilege of having more prep time. This won't make them dull, it'll make them spend more time thinking which is good. 

balancing teams in debates

  

Very important to tell people to cross over, shake hands, and get the community going, instead of people staying in their own seats

  
  
  

In feedback, also focus on what they did right, to encourage them to do this next time

  
  

Also a great way to give feedback to debaters, is ask them questions about their case, like, "Why do you think this is true?", and once they answer, say, "This is good reasoning which should have come out in your speech". This solves 2 problems. 1. It doesn't make your feedback feel obvious to them, and more importantly, 2. It makes them feel good about themselves, and make them realize it isn't an IQ issue but a presentation issue.

  
  

speaker scores are cringe to give in mocks
'omg they won't know how speaker scores work in real tournaments then' is a weak excuse. slowly toughening people up is important, and keeping them happy to some level. When they've already had a bad day, shit speaks can further mess the up.
  
  
  

scheduling, pains of us attending more sessions than recruits themselves

  

every year we have seniors take up voluntary adjing slots or whatever but it never works out.

  

Senior judge: junior participant ratio is a big deal. Early on too many juniors. One way to combat is having more seniors. Another way is spreading out sessions even more.

Having too many seniors always better than too less seniors, you can always pro am case prep or something

Adjust with adj, or sometimes adjust with fake 'reply' speaker

  
  
  

# Keeping up debate spirit and passion:
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

For the love of god, there are better motions than THW legalize weed to use as an example when teaching debate. 
- Most freshers don't know about the system of the black market, or the psychologies of druggies, so a drug debate can feel disconnected.
- So when you teach mech and impacting it, it doesn't feel as real. If you used a parenting motion, children could easily understand mech and impacting when they relate to it.
- Even flipping is easy to understand in a parenting motion, saying that constant reminders to study make you less studious.

The counter arguments I've heard about this are
- It's short and sweet, that's why it comes to mind easily.
- It's more enticing and an, "oooooo" topic.
- It's cool to blow people's minds when you make a gov case, cuz they're used to dissing on weed.
- It's a cool demonstration of a flip, saying that banning it makes it worse. 
- "If the first motion I encounter in the soc is something dry like parents and education I might leave"


one on one time is extremely extremely important to make people feel like they exist, and that their presence is valued

  

Heavily encourage spectators, a lot of people find it easier to opt in, both already recruits and future people

  
  

Good to talk about how you went through the same struggles, and used to fumble glorification, narrative, and THR motions in your first year too

  
  

Akshath Saxena, seniors need to have and show passion for it to flow to juniors

  
  

we used to make everyone vote on the poll, even if it was a no. But it might be bad for optics to have many nos.

  

A good way to make people feel valued is to remember them by their name and call them by their name, make some reference to a thing they had said on a previous day, etc etc

  

Put extra effort to talk to everyone so that they don't feel like they're part of an 'outgroup'.

  

don't alienate mun people because a lot of people try out both clubs. take the high road, don't turn off people by spewing mun hate. Even if I didn't like mun, I'd lose respect for a debsoc member who needed to hate on mun to make debate look valuable.

  
  

the narrative of adjing being bad is spread through statements like, "You'd better come early next time if you wanna speak", etc

  

Especially in tourneys, ask questions about rounds, constantly acknowledge their existence, judging feels really lonely otherwise

  
quote the adjing thing from how to start a debating society.


A lot of time there are people who genuinely care about improving in debating but don't attend sessions

  

Tourney reg, assign teams yourself, ask participants to reg, not as 'speakers' or 'judges', and later assign yourself based on what you see


  freeloaders need to be banned. It's awkward, but you need to stand your ground.
  

Share motion, share random fun pictures, make people feel the fomo

  

a lot of people who stay in debsoc are friendless otherwise, so the community and friendship really does mean a lot to them

  

Nobody thinks that debating would be more productive than studying, regardless of how much debating adds value to your life. Second year onwards, the main reason people would come is because of the community.

  

Inertia is huge, don't let them go too long without debating. Try to have some scene in vacations, and try to start debating the moment a new academic semester starts

  

As Aditi Mallya girls said, mix it up, have fun, keep debating fun, do random stuff like Alley debating

Also turncoat, especially on low turnout days


  

talk about how the windows of opportunity to do big things like cubbon sessions or group gatherings are limited because of how students have alternating ISAs, so avoid putting off opportunities hoping for better opportunities in the future.

  

Talk about whatsapp group chats and why you need an admins only sessions group
