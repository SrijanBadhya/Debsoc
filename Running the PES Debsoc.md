# This House Would...

Welcome valued Debsoc core member

The purpose of this document is to pass on knowledge, to prevent future batches from repeating mistakes, and to make tried-and-tested solutions repeatable.
As seniors, it's our responsibility to not make our juniors feel lost about running the club. This document is extensive, but I want to make you aware of every incident that can pop up during recruitments and debate sessions.

A lot of these solutions may seem like common knowledge, but I believe it's important that these are pondered and have motivated effort behind their implementation.

- As every coder knows, replacing an existing solution with a different solution, could lead to other problems popping up.
- So every solution I talk about will have reasoning, what it's meant to solve, and its flaws that still persist. As long as you're aware of these reasons, you will be better informed in which system to choose, and will make thoughtful changes.
- I believe that every batch will be able to improve upon existing systems.[^1] Every change should be a step forward, instead of causing old problems to resurface.
- An ideal change would patch up existing flaws without opening up the flaws covered by old systems. However sometimes trade-offs must be made, and I trust you in weighing which flaws are worth handling.

[^1]: I haven't yet figured out how exactly I'll add other people's input into this document with their name, but it'll probably be a combination of github pull requests and writing their name before their points. Probably even passing control on.

**So who am I, and why care about what's written here?**
~~It feels cringe to type this~~
I'm Srijan Badhya, a member of Debate Shenanigans 3.0 (if you still follow that chronological system). I've been a part of around 200 debates with PES Debsoc members across my 4 years. I've helped conduct recruitments for 3 batches, and experienced the recruitment for my own batch. I have experienced being under different leaders, and have experience trying different forms of leadership myself. I've engaged with dozens of juniors about how they feel in the soc. I've talked to debaters from other colleges about how they believe societies should be run. There are too many people to credit in the making of this book, in fact, they're everyone I've had the honor of meeting across my debate career. 
You can contact me at srijanbadhya@gmail.com or artemisrijan@gmail.com, I'll definitely reply within a week. 

There already exists a globally famous document, [How to Start a Debate Society](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAni64_JD4Uu6N00kryFs0j_W7q1Heeb/view). I felt that it was necessary to have something more tailored to PES, tailored to the state of the PES Debsoc at the moment, and hence I embarked on this project.

==This document is long and I don't want you to give up halfway, so this will be the format of the content:==
In true debate fashion, this handbook will have my claims about what to follow, and what to keep in mind for decisions. 
- If you believe in the claim and decide to implement it, you can skip the reasons and move on. **(try to skip as many bullet points as you can so that you don't lose the will to read this document)**
- If you disagree instead, I implore you to read the reasoning behind the claim. If you're able to take down these reasons with a better claim, a better system, or outweigh them, then you should go ahead with this better claim. 

It does take effort to keep these policies implemented, and I want to be able to convince you that it is worth the effort to implement something instead of believing, "What happens naturally is enough".
I don't want mistakes from the past to repeat because I wasn't able to empower my juniors with functional systems.
I believe it's good to keep in mind the merits and demerits of alternate policies while implementing a particular policy.


The claims will be in **bold**, and the reasons will be in white bullet points. But first let me talk about the guiding values which are the basis for all the claims here (what we prioritized in our decisions).
Alternate systems conceptualized or once followed will be in _italics_. 

**My whole yap isn't to say, "This is what you _should_ follow", but to just explain the frontier of my knowledge and lay out my case, hoping that you can overcome limitations, expand the frontier, and make better systems.**

# Guiding Principles

## The Point of a Debate Club
2 parts: Debate, and Club

_There have been people who say that the point of a debate club is to debate, and it's bad to chill too much_
I believe chilling is fine, in so far as it assists in the direction of the purpose of the club. (there I said it, the first and last time I use that debate phrase!!)

The single biggest purpose of a club is to ==provide value to every single member.==


Why do people want to join a club?

- They believe the activity will be enjoyable.
- They believe they'll learn something from the activity.
- They believe they'll be able to hang out with nice fun people.

I will henceforth link all my arguments to these impacts of joy, growth, and community.
I believe a club should not stray away from meeting these 3 needs of its members. 
The needs are heavily disagreed upon, and the methods even more so. 



_**Some have believed that the point of the debate club is to win tournaments and get accolades.**_

- _This does initially make sense since our tournament results are what our PES management sees._
- _And the debsoc cares about getting funded by PES because that's how we get to go to more fun tournaments._

**However, some of us believe that if you judge the club solely by its tournament wins, you may lose sight of what matters, and a number of unhealthy behaviors can creep in.**

- To win tournaments, you might start prioritizing your attention to the people who already show potential and debate skills, to hone them further.
- This could also mean that when you have limited tournament slots or resources, you give them to people already performing well.
- **A hierarchy forms and people feel like worthless members when they're not the ones bringing in the accolades.** 
- When a good debater becomes problematic, you're willing to let it slide because they're 'valuable to the soc'.
  + They may continue ruining the debate club experience for everyone else, while still bringing in tournament wins.
  + By utilitarian metrics, this reduces the number of people who enjoy debate, enjoy the club, and hence reduces the breadth and depth of the value given by the club.
- You might get depressed over the Debsoc 'deteriorating' when the people are actually doing fine. They're still enjoying the club and enjoying debate.
- You might be cringe and hesitate to work with other societies and give good feedback because they're 'rival societies' who are 'taking away your wins'.

**Most of the benefits are accessible even when you don't solely care about tournament wins. You can still achieve joy, growth, and community without grinding solely for tournament wins.**

- In the 2020-2023 timeframe, the PES management still freely provided reimbursement for tourneys, regardless of the lack of breaks we had in quite a few tourneys. **PES seems to fund us to support activity in the club, more than 'bringing PES name and fame', which they enjoy as a side effect, not the main purpose.**
- A bit of extra seriousness might lead to better 'results', but this can significantly take away from joy and the community, so be careful what extent you're doing it to.
  + **Debating should not feel like studying. People shouldn't feel guilty for not putting in the work. People shouldn't be so turned off by the concept of having to output results that they don't enjoy the activity itself.** 

_Some people believe that even having 3 members is enough as long as they're constantly debating and grinding. (The debsoc did reach this point in 2020 I believe.)_ 
Some of us (including me) believe that being more chill and having more people for fun, is worth it, even if it slows our improvement in debating. 

- A big reason people engage with the debate club is for community, for their friends, for fun with them, so I believe that having enjoyable chill time goes a long way in getting people to stay, and also motivates them to debate more. 
- So this isn't as mutually exclusive as it seems, I believe that sacrificing chillness for grinding is worse than sacrificing grinding for chillness, because the chillness and fun motivates people to come to debates and grow anyway. 
- I don't think you should worry about being too chill and lenient, because being hardcore and strict tends to cause a worse effect in debaters ([but more on that later](#push-to-come-to-sessions)).


<br>



### Metrics
So if not tournament wins, what metric _do_ you judge the club by?
I personally say don't judge the club at all. 

- In theory, metrics are useful to judge a club to see whether the systemic change you implemented had any positive effect or not.
- However, unfortunately, Debsoc is not like a machine learning model where you can instantly see the result of one tweak. You usually can't even clearly pinpoint the cause of a change in the state of the soc that you see. A million different factors affect everything, and the only way to retrospectively decide whether a change was good or bad, is if you can somehow derive that the change directly caused certain impacts.
- Sure you can ask people how they felt about a certain change, and take this feeling as a metric. The priority is the happiness of the members, more than any results.
- _Common metrics people often take are tournament wins, number of active members, or number of active members in sessions, etc._
- Unfortunately even the result from such a metric can be misleading. Just because you have less members this year doesn't mean you were shit at running the club. There are more factors out of your control than you can imagine.
- 'How skilled juniors are' shouldn't be the metric of whether you are a good mentor, because everyone has different starting points. It's about whether they're getting better. It's about whether they feel happy in this club.
- If you do _have_ to take metrics, try to somehow link them to the joy, growth, and interpersonal well-being of the members.

 
  

# Recruitments
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Recruitment Concepts
  
This is the single most important activity of a club.

This is the single place (besides arguably PESDT) where systems matter the most, because 
1. You have an enormous scaled up load of people and documentation to handle.
2. This is the first impression of the juniors of the soc and shapes whether they want to continue or not. A process that isn't smooth can be damaging.

### History
First, a brief view on how recruitments were done in the past:
_For my batch (2021, but recruitments ended up happening in the January of 2022), we had one online round with a quick 1v1 debate, since this was the covid era. 3+1 minute speeches with one witness, and once the debate ended, we had no contact._
_The debsoc would take in everyone who participated in this round._
_For my first juniors, we had a similar format but offline._ 

Here we naturally arrive at the big question of inclusivity.

How do you handle the trade-off between being inclusive/selective?


Pros of being selective:
- A few PES clubs (like ECell), try to be extremely selective with their members. This generates initial hype over being a 'member of ECell'.
- People believe that less members means less dilution and you can focus more.
- It's way easier to deny entry to someone than it is to kick them out later.
- You want to have people who actually care about debate so that you don't feel the emptiness of 100 members on a groupchat but nobody responding.
- People feel comfortable to text their thoughts on the groupchat when they actually know the people, not when half of the people are people they have ever seen.
- Eventually small clubs will have more club loyalty than big clubs, especially when in a big club you have random people reading group chats for entertainment, and passing on rumors about seniors to the point where it becomes damaging.

<br>
However, since 2023, the debsoc, with the idea of Harsha, found a way increase selectivity while being inclusive.
The first round remained the same. 

_The second round was a 'group discussion', with one moderator and 6 recruits. And the one who scored more 'points' would be the one who engaged more._
And the third round was a month long, with sessions everyday, and people who attended the most sessions would be recruited.

In 2024, we got rid of the group discussion round and replaced it with an AP round. I think the 2024 model is the best model we've had so far, and I'll come to it later. 

I'll come to the group discussion part later, but **the month-long recruitment was extremely useful** for a few reasons:

- Since it wasn't confined to a particular few days, people could come according to the flexibility of their schedule. 
- People could get a feel of debate before they committed.
- People self filtered themselves out, so by the end people who were still consistent were people who were genuinely interested.
- Glaring issues could pop up and we could be aware of problematic people before taking them into the club.
- Recruits would form bonds and some amount of loyalty would be built up, reducing the chances of them leaking info from the group later as backstabbing.
- This was the best way to measure if someone could be an asset to the club in the future; if they would participate enthusiastically and be able to set aside time for debsoc.
- **In our messages to the recruits, we kept telling them that we were measuring their consistency. Unfortunately some people interpreted this as 'consistently high performance', instead of 'high attendance'. One guy showed up for one debate, and complained to me later that he wasn't taken in even though he won 1/1 debates. So be careful with your phrasing. Using the word 'attendance' is also risky cuz it's a turn-off like college.**

(Having a round 1 and a round 2 before this month long recruitment is still useful because
- People filter themselves out after round 1 and round 2, and you'll have less data to handle in round 3.
- + Handling data consistently and accurately in recruitments is extremely challenging, since the more names you have, the time taken to perform all operations like searching, marking, and copying increases, and the chance for names to slip by increases.)

A few issues with the month long recruitment:
- You need to reserve a block of a month for recruitments. In 2024 there were 3 weeks left in the semester in November, and hence round 3 got pushed to 2025.
- First year B.Tech and other branches have different exam schedules, and people will always be super anxious about not being able to come the week of exams and the week before (first years be like).
- + Another issue this leads to is that if all the active seniors belong to B. Tech, then there's nobody to conduct sessions when B. Tech has exams.
- People feel like a month is too much commitment for a club they might not get selected into anyway. (To solve this, you may have to try to increase people's confidence that you will take them in).
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/N6PpM10X/FEAR-OF-ATTENDING-BUT-STILL-NOT-MAKING-IT-IN.png)


This level of selectivity captured the most benefits, and I believe that aiming to be more selective gives diminishing marginal benefits and leads to more harms.

Which takes us to, **why we should push hard for inclusivity**:

When you see 240ish people on the recruitments group, you might be intimidated by how to run such a massive club (the way we were). However, the pattern I've seen across the years is that 20% of people don't even show up for round 1 and 50% of people don't show up for round 3.
And even among those who get recruited, 80% of people stop coming to sessions by the time second year begins.


### Depth wise inclusivity
So the reasons for being inclusive regardless of 'skill' are:

- The point of the club is not to filter based on skill, but to take everyone who is interested, and help them pursue this interest. 
- - The focus is not on who the people are now, they're freshers. The focus is on who they can become. And how the soc and the person will be able to contribute towards the growth of each other. 
- Skilled debaters aren't our only assets. Our assets are people who participate and contribute to the activity of the club. People who enable debates to happen, APs and even BPs to happen by just being there. Every person is precious. Without people there is no debate. Without people there is no soc.
- Debate is a weird activity where love can grow over time, and everyone has potential to be lukewarm at first but grow love for it later (I took 3 years to like debating).
- - A good debater can always end up stopping debating. A bad debater can always have a growth arc. In the face of this uncertainty, the best metric available is their consistency, their dedication.

So there isn't much clear benefit of having a tight filter. A loose filter works good enough. To a large extent, it's better to start with more people than less.
**Accidentally leaving an interested person out is usually more expensive than accidentally taking an uninterested person in.**

Taking a few points out of Nikhil's recruitment document:
- It would be unfair to judge candidates on their initial skill set without giving them a chance to improve.
- "Even in the ‘worst case’ - if a participant still does not show any significant improvement debate-wise, if the person has put in the effort and work to show up for the sessions consistently, they deserve a place in the society for the following reasons:
- + Improvement is usually imminent. People improve at different rates; some people are slow learners (including myself), and some people struggle with other things outside their control. But the fact that these people are consistent is a good indicator of their work ethic and willingness to learn.
- + On a principle level, we cannot dissuade people from being members of the society except for equity reasons. The only absolute metric that a person can be judged by is their consistency and effort into the activity, and regardless of ability, these traits must be appreciated."


### ==Breadth wise inclusivity==
This has somehow become one of the most controversial practices of the society. **If you're against being too accommodating of people, please bear with me as I yap, so that you end up with whatever belief stands at the end.**

By breadth wise inclusivity, I mean providing multiple slots and multiple days for people to get their round 1 and round 2 finished. Extra days for the people who need it. Round 3 also needs to be open enough for even people with packed lives to be able to reach the minimum bar. 

Absolutely do not aim to recruit a percentage of applicants, like deciding, "The top 90% will be recruited". This is dumb for the same reasons that percentiles in competitive exams are dumb; just because someone was in the bottom 10% doesn't mean that they don't know how to solve math or don't like doing math. It's better to measure marks in an exam (or whatever you use as an indication of interest like sessions). 


We usually conduct round 1 across 3 days, so that people can come on any day according to their flexibility. Round 2 also usually is similarly over 3 other days. 

**How are there always people who miss out?** What are the reasons that often happen?
- When you scale it up to 250ish recruits, 100 have a chance of being available 2 out of the 3 days, 120 have a chance of being available 1 out of 3 days, and there are usually 30ish people unable to make it on one out of these 3 particular days. Even if something is just 9% likely, when you take a sample of 100 people, you get 9 people this event likely happens to.
- This could be due to being sick, having some extracurricular class some day, having a high priority assignment one day, anything. Even if these same unlikely, likelihood scales up with people. 
- **Moreover, Recruitments are usually held in October November, many students go home for a whole week during Diwali or Navarathri, or have a one-week PESU IO course, which can't be changed regardless of how interested they are in the Debsoc.**
- We get swamped with requests from these people who were sick, or out of town, and care enough to text us because they want to join the club.
- + However you cannot measure this texting as the only indication of interest to join the club, because there are people who would like to express interest, who are unaware that they can text the clubheads and beg to join this way. 
- + If you do send out a message asking for all the absentees to dm you, then you can use this as indication of interest. 
It's extreme and unnecessary to initiate the text conversation yourself in the dms of everyone on the group you see. 


#### ==Addressing the criticism==
1. _Criticism of 'being too inclusive' goes along the lines of recruits becoming lazy and apathetic if they see a club 'desperately' going out of their way to pull in people. The prestige of a club is proportional to how selective it is, and the debsoc needs to be prestigious._
2. _One thing that I've heard is, "it definitely makes us look unstructured, unorganised, and bad planners which means people won't take debsoc seriously and feel they will get away with not coming for sessions and when we tell them they can't go to tourneys without sessions, automatically they'll leave the soc"._
3. _Scarcity leads to an increase in value._

First, let's break the recruits into 2 groups of people:
Group 1, the people that you'd recruit by having a 3 day recruitment, a fairly strict round 1 and round 2, and also a medium-high bar to pass through round 3. 
Group 2, the extra people that you'll get by putting extra effort to be extra accommodating of people. 

_The assumption behind the criticism is that group 1 is filled with people who care, will continue to be hardworking, and will contribute a lot to the PES debsoc. And that group 2 is the lazy people who barely made it into the club._

The thing is, simply taking group 2 into the club isn't going to significantly impact the people of group 1, since group 1 already cares about debate. If I'm already a consistent debater and did my round 1 on time and round 2 on time, I don't feel harmed by the debsoc letting more people in later. I don't lose interest in debate just because lazier people got in. 

(I'm only impacted if there was a lack of transparency, like if I missed my mom's birthday to be at the session on day 3, and now suddenly the debsoc tells me I could have come tomorrow. This is solved by group 2 people having to put extra effort anyway, like having to dm a club head, or having to hope that they make it through the 'unofficial recruitments' (something we did in 2025 which I'll mention later)). Group 1 people still get the benefit of peace of mind of completing their task, which they earned by being there on time.

Group 2 is already assumed to not take the Debsoc seriously, so if accommodating them makes them lazier and causes half of them to drop out soon, it's still a net positive because these are people you wouldn't have had to begin with.


People's interest in debate can fall or rise over time, based on what they discover about debate as time passes, and whether they like what they discover [(From the feedback form)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059).

![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/SsPZgzmd/Interestovertime4.png)

This blue box touches upon a very complicated problem, which is the challenge seeming so massive that you give up on it, unaware that the bar will be lower. I don't know how to solve this without the contradictory messaging of "Guys come to as many sessions as possible", and "You just need to do 2 sessions in the whole month of round 3 to get into the club".
![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/ZYGmRW66/Interestovertime5-with-bonus.png)
A lot of people in group 1 will drop out due to **falling interest**. However, if you hadn't been extra accommodating, you'd never have gotten members from group 2 whose interest would have **risen over time** instead because debate turned out to be more fun than they had thought. 
Losing people who lose interest over time is fine, but we can't afford to have lost people whose interest grows over time.

It's unfair to judge people's initial interest in an activity if some of them didn't even know that it was as exciting as it is. A few people don't come to the initial days of round 3 (because they'd rather hang out with their friends after classes instead of debsoc strangers), but come more often in the last 2 weeks because they're more interested in it and debsoc people are fun to be with. (Sure, the last-minute worried grind effect does take place, but certain people have casually told me that they showed up more as time passed because only later did they really start to enjoy debsoc).


If it still looks speculative that you can find valuable people in group 2, I'll name drop a few major contributory debaters. Harsha didn't get in through round 1, and he pestered the clubheads to take him in at the time. Sarah had lukewarm interest in debate for the first few weeks before she spammed sessions. Shreya was absent for most of round 3 due to health issues. I didn't really like debating for my first 2 years in the debsoc. The bottom line is that it's easy to miss out on good people if you have a high attendance criterion for round 3.

Continuing the response to criticism: (point [2.](#addressing-the-criticism)) (people will feel they can get away with stuff)
- You won't look like bad planners since the reason for the extension is not you, but rather them, the recruits who didn't make it to the round 1 yet. 
- Prestige isn't some tangible value. You don't need to be a prestigious club. You need to be a good club which people have positive thoughts about. Being less inclusive because you care about prestige, hampers your 3 main goals: growth, community, and enjoyment of the people, since you have less people to provide value to.
- It's way easier for people to bitch, "This club was so unfair and I couldn't get in", than for people to bitch, "This club was so easy and they took nearly everybody in". The image of the club won't be ruined if you aren't strict, in fact, it'll be better.
- In feedback forms people have been very appreciative of our inclusivity and flexibility, which makes them feel cared for.
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/rGyg39VV/Inclusivity.png)
- Moreover, image like this is a speculative harm, and it weighs poorly against the real literal harm of people not being included even though they want to be. The principle of accessibility and inclusivity weighs over this speculative future. It's hard to pinpoint the exact causes of people losing interest and dropping out. 
- However, it is very valid to have a low bar to get into the soc, but a high bar to get into a tourney. 
- + Having a high bar to get into the soc is making debate itself completely inaccessible to the recruit, blocks away all mutual contribution that could have ensued from their entry, and doesn't even allow for a growth in interest or consistency later because that isn't measured. 
- + It doesn't cause serious harm on the soc to take more people in. 
- + However, with a tournament, reimbursed slots are limited because PES management applies pressure to us to reduce the number of people going, and it's hard to push back against this. Reimbursement of a tournament is a very valid people to give to the people who have contributed the most to the soc; the people who have shown up the most for sessions. More on this in [Tournaments](#tournaments).
- + The argument of, "people will get accustomed to a low bar so they'll leave the soc if they see a sudden high bar for tournaments", isn't something really caused by the low bar to enter the soc.
The criticism of, "Scarcity leads to an increase in value" has been applied for taking multiple matter sessions as well. 

A major problem of the soc is lack of members who actively debate 3 months after recruitments, but having more selective recruitments won't solve the problem. People don't get 'seriousness' by knowing that the club they entered had strict filtration. Any ego boost from having made it through the challenging recruitments, only has a very short-term effect in how much they show up for sessions. 
And nobody ever thinks this thought:
"If we had taken lesser people, we could have had more people today". 

Continuing the response to criticism (point [3.](#addressing-the-criticism))(scarcity is proportional to value): 
- There are already 2 conflicting ideas. If you're doing it even for a few people on a particular day, it could also mean that the matter session is so valuable that you know these people can't afford to miss out on it, and that's why you're doing it for them. Different people might subscribe to different of these 2 beliefs, and so multiple options might even increase the value in their eyes. (Even for people who already have attended the session/recruitment, the debsoc showing that they care for its recruits increases their like for the club, as shown in the picture earlier).
- The initial poll of availability allows people to vote multiple options. Why would someone lie on a poll like this? If someone is available only on Friday (as explained earlier), then how would limiting the days to Tuesday and Wednesday convince this person to opt in? Missing out on this person is a real tangible harm, rather than the speculative harm of this being the tipping point to give them enough disinterest to not participate in the recruitment at all.
- There are 3 groups of people, people who really _do_ want to come to recruitments/a matter session, people who really _don't_ want to come to recruitments/a matter session, and people on the fence. Most people belong to groups 1 and 2. Even for people in group 3, to me it's quite far-fetched for me to think that increasing the matter session days from 2 days to 6 days will be THE major factor (the tipping point) which deters them from showing up to the matter session. 
- The issue with limiting days is that you're quite likely to lose someone from even group 1 (and others from group 2 for whom this extension thing is _not_ the tipping point). Regardless of them being interested in debsoc, there are often clashing events, clashing plans, and other stuff explained before which forcefully prevents them from accessing the value of the matter session.
- If there's a tradeoff to be made then sure, you can limit the options. If there's an actual harm of efficiency(delays), or preventing some other event, or consuming your time. There's just no trade-off of "interest in people/turnout", because there's more likelihood of losing interested people to this than gaining people on the fence.


So, how do you carry out breadth-wise inclusivity?

- I staunchly believe that inclusivity should be maximized if you have the bandwidth to accommodate these people.
- I took this to the extreme, and since I had free bandwidth in my 4th year, I would go to first year classrooms even 2 weeks after official round 1 recruitments to conduct unofficial recruitments for the people who had asked me. I don't recommend going this extreme without having the bandwidth yourself.
- But if you have 4 people left to do their rounds even the next week, I advocate for trying to do their round 1 in your free time the next week.
- There are always people who are unaware of debsoc because our marketing didn't reach them, and want to join only after their friends who have completed round 1, tell them about it. 
- New people show up for round 2 all the time, and I believe that we should accommodate them by conducting their round 2 and then a round 1 for them later.
- I believe that everyone the debsoc can possibly reach, should be reached. But if you don't have the capacity to do so, then your capacity is a fine place to draw the line.
- One issue is that extending recruitments like this can cause transparency issues, when you try to pressure people to come saying, "Last day guys!", and still proceed to accommodate people who needed it after that. 
- + The way we sneakily side-stepped this last year was by saying, "Thursday is the last day for official recruitments", and then on Friday saying, "anyone who still wants to get recruited needs to dm one of the club heads".
- You can choose the stance on transparency that fits you the best.
- Ensure that this doesn't cause a delay in recruitments. Starting round 2 late because round 1 isn't over is dumb, the bulk of round 1s should be finished in a maximum of 3 days. The delay can be avoided if you conduct extra round 1s for the few odd people while round 2 goes on. Especially since round 1 doesn't take up much time, it's easy to fit in people while another group of people prep.


The drastic drop of people across recruitments and even beyond is unavoidable and happens every year. Don't beat yourself up over it, it's normal. You will feel frustrated about all the time and effort you put for these people, but remember:
- **Even if people are temporary, they still contributed to the activity of the club for the time that they were there, and that's enough.**
- You did your part, you provided value to them, and your effort contributed towards the vision of the Debsoc.
- Every bit that you did, made you slightly better at debating, slightly better at organizing, and more knowledgeable of how people management works.

Alright then, why have a recruitment in the first place? Why not just take everyone that wants to join the club, into the club?
Having an inclusive round 1, round 2, and round 3, while having a low bar for selectivity, gives us like 80% of the benefits that I talk about in [History](#history). And the best part is that people stop showing up to debates during the month of round 3, that means they've lost interest and have filtered themselves out. And hence you don't need to add people to a group they don't want to be in.


## The 2024 model
### Round 1
Further developments from the 2023 model designed in 2024 by Nikhil:

I'll just quote from Nikhil's document here. 

 - Round 1 now has 2 speeches of 4 minutes each from each person (like a half BP, no POIs).
 - 10 minute prep time.
 - + There is an increase in prep time from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. A lot of new debaters are intimidated by the process and struggle to kickstart idea generation, let alone structure and reasoning for the arguments. I personally was confused by the motion wording and felt a general sense of panic given the limited prep time during my round 1. An additional 5 minutes would help participants calm down, giving them enough leeway to structure their arguments and be ready to present them. 10 minutes is long enough to generate the level of arguments expected in round 1 but short enough to handle the scale of multiple people in a day.
 - After the speeches, the moderator asks questions to clarify logical gaps that the speakers may have missed in their speeches, giving them a chance to clarify themselves in a conversational manner.
 - The moderator later asks them retrospective questions on what they could have done better and how they would have argued for the other side.
 - + Previously, the moderator used to be passive in adjudicating the debate. Participants would leave after the speeches, and the moderator would note their inputs. In the new system, the moderator becomes more involved and 2 "enters the debate," interacting with the speakers and questioning them about various aspects of the debate. Here are a few reasons for this change:
 - + + Without 'active moderation', there is a feeling of mystery and anxiety after the speeches are over. The moderator passively tracks the debate, and participants are unsure about the metrics they are being judged on.
 - + + Most participants may have an intuitive understanding of the case, but it might not have come out in the speeches due to the new format and general anxiety of a recruitment round. The questions by the moderators are meant to allow speakers to explain themselves in a more conversational manner while allowing them to retrospectively analyze their case. The questions are aimed at understanding how well a participant responds to an issue in the debate that the moderator has pointed out.
 - + + From the participant's point of view, they feel that the process is more personal and feels like an interview of sorts. The questions assess them over multiple metrics, and they are also able to understand their performances better in retrospect.
 - + + In practice, this conversation is usually fun and leaves the freshers with the impression of, "Wow these seniors are so cool, nice and fun!" (as per what we've seen in the feedback form). This interaction is where freshers usually have fun, and this makes them want to keep coming back.
 - Example questions moderators could ask:
 - + "You mentioned point X and explained how that leads to impact Y. Could you provide more reasons how X leads to Y? Is X the only reason Y happens?"
 - + "Regarding point X brought out by the other speaker, you responded by saying Y. Do you think this effectively countered point X? How could you have responded better?"
 - + "What do you think was the most important impact you were trying to convey in your speech? Why do you think that is the most important issue in the debate?"
 - + "If there was a point you could have elaborated on more, what would that have been, and what new angles would you have added?"
 - + "Is there something you think the opposite speaker missed that you predicted they would say?"
 

I think these changes by Nikhil were absolutely amazing, they made the recruitment process so much more fun and engaging for both the moderators and recruits.
- Avoid letting the question session go on too long if you have a queue of participants waiting for their turn.

### Round 2
Quoting Nikhil on the issues in the Group Discussion format of 2023:

- A lot of participants were introverted or had social anxiety, and though they had ideas to contribute to the discussion, a lack of confidence prevented them from doing so.
- The group discussion format quickly turns into a ‘loudest person gets the room’ kind of situation, where a person comfortable with pushing their ideas through and holding their stance through all the noise wins.
- The discussion takes the shape of the social dynamic holding the group in place, which dilutes the breadth and quality of discussion.

Why is this bad?
- Except maybe for panel deliberation, the skills tested in the group discussion round are never explicitly used in parliamentary debating. Sure, skills like quick thinking and being adaptive are transferable, but there are other methods to assess this.
- Participants might leave with the impression that cutting through the noise and voicing out their opinion is rewarded, and those who cannot do this will be dissuaded. This is bad because it goes against the fundamental aspects of debating, which are to carefully listen to other arguments and present yours without the fear of interruption.
- Many participants, including myself, felt left out of the conversation due to the social dynamics of the discussion. The moderator did try to include all participants manually, but this did not solve the fundamental problem with the method of testing.
- (From Srijan) A huge chunk of our loyal debaterbase comes from people who struggle with social anxiety who commit to the debsoc in hopes of getting better at public speaking. One bad (misleading) experience like this can be enough for them to give up hope.


Nikhil's round 2 in 2024 had the following features:
- It was a 3v3 AP lite with 4 minute speeches instead of 3.
- Participants prep together while the speaker positions are kept a mystery by the judge.
- The PM and LO positions are announced at the end of prep time.
- After the first 2 speeches, both teams are given 5 minutes to discuss among themselves for the next 2 speeches.
- At the end of this time, the DPM and DLO are announced.
- After these 2 speeches, there are 5 minutes of discussion time before the Gov whip and Opp whip.
- There are still no POIs in this format.

Why is this new model better?
- It is important for participants to experience the team aspect of parliamentary debating before progressing to future rounds. Most debating involves collaborating with people to build and deconstruct arguments together, so it is essential to ensure that potential candidates are willing to work in a team. The group discussion format does not test this and rewards individualism.
- Group discussion portrays the wrong picture of what debsoc activities will be like. People who might like debating but dislike group discussion will be dissuaded from joining the soc. People who like group discussion but not the rest of debate will also be mismatched.
- Unknown Speaker Position: This incentivizes teammates to prep together and distribute the content they prepare equally across speakers. This prevents preparation from being focused on one speaker while others are just focused on responsive speeches. It emphasizes building the case and adds incentives for everyone to contribute and be ready since they could be the first speaker for their team.
- Mid-Debate Strategy Sessions: This helps teammates assess their performance in real time and plan their strategy accordingly. The first speaker gives inputs on what they couldn’t cover, and the team plans on rebuttals and the direction to take the debate in. The second speaker is not fixed yet, so the incentive process from the previous step continues.
- Focus on Teamwork: This process won’t be perfect - speakers may not fulfill their roles perfectly, and there might be analytical gaps in their speeches. This is alright. The point is to test how well speakers can work together as a team. And the participant also finds out how much they enjoy working in a team, and can better assess whether they want to join the soc.
- We also had a feedback form post round 2 for recruits to talk about the attitudes of their teammates, which helped us judge everyone, and helped us keep a note of signs of equity issues.

Also, I would recommend checking up on both teams during case prep, and to ensure that there's a dynamic between all 3 of them (in case one person isn't speaking up as much as they should). It doesn't hurt to prompt them with a few questions (as long as you do it equally to both teams), because it leads to a higher quality debate.

End of the recruitment secion I have properly written, any readers please move on to [Inside a session](#inside-a-session) for now.


Talk about what wasn't implementable from Nikhil's model either. 
how making people pro-am, making people adj once, tracking if they've done all speaker positions once, didn't really come to fruition and it was more effort than it was worth.




explain why no pois.

Scoring is not important.

Major benefit of self filtration and rounds is that 60% of the people drop out in round 1 and 2, so you're better able to handle the people who are left in round 3. You have better expectations of how many will show up.

juniors are unaware that they even have the right to judge, so make sure you give them the option to, always.




Avoid disclosing the exact number of sessions the cutoff was, because people might think that that is the expectation for them, and be dissuaded from attending many.

round 3 in 2023

Fake names added at the bottom.

This incentive to debate is only short term

From the stuff I forwarded to Anirudh:

Don't know if you got this already but here are the recruitment tabs of last year if you want a reference https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dw2C0WZDU81iWJNsbwRixbpRiAfiQjuThH8jI7JFz64/edit#gid=538046766

The reason why I'm advocating for a google form linked to sheets is because it can improve on some issues like missing chair slots and a lot of missing phone numbers. And pinging people on the whatsapp group is too much of a pain and sometimes it won't work out

missing chair slots impact trackability on people

and having only the phone number impacts trackability because people can mess up one digit, or forget to add the phone number. I think adding email is beneficial in case the phone number link to a student fails

you'll notice human errors here like duplicated entries for gov and opp, usually solved in a google form with compulsory questions for speaker 1 and 2

Excel's ease of use is incredibly low cause it has random keybord shortcuts, and dragging a cell normally will copy its content to other cells

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M2WkJ_aRrPAt8rKpz8pQXULVlVxOX8AjUCiqUCWwl28/edit?pli=1#gid=1593421135 this is how we did round 3 last year btw

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wqDueQaUqx8TkVNi5iS_a-iretiSL-CdvE7ugtJY5s/edit#gid=0 and we published this list showing who was accepted and who was rejected

Also we said, "If you have less than 5 debates then dm us", although in reality we picked all the people who did at least 2 sessions 😂😂

End of forwards to Anirudh



(talk about wrapping up recruitments fast to push tournaments early. Tournaments are good because they provide direction and something to work for. They also make debate feel very real).



[Feedback from recruits, halfway through the month of round 3](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059)
This feedback form does contain some sensitive information, but since it's anonymous, the average person shouldn't be able to recognize anyone. And hopefully by the time relevant people read this, the people will either be dead, will have forgotten details, or will be able to laugh it off.


We often do this weird thing where we don't make them feel safe and like, "they've already debated enough to be in", because we don't want them to be lazy and stop showing up, but I don't think it's good to give them anxiety either and psych them later.
We play around with them
  

make sure everyone is on the same page with respect to recruitments, last year we had a few random people suddenly change the format last minute.

The sneaky thing about our recruitment model is that what people will be doing before the end of round 3, is the same as what they'll be doing once they're recruited, which is coming to sessions every week. What difference do they feel then? To make them feel like there's a difference, you can say that now they're in the club, they have access to tournaments. 

## Recruitment Logistics

Talk about how we thought about handling the load by having slots. But this is way too complicated and didn't work out (explain why), so the best way is actually to make careful polls, and if one day has a super high load, encourage people from that day to come on a low load day. 

Talk about how system, data filling errors are so common, regardless of how careful you think you are

code word stuff in round 2, people talk about their teammates, they don't remember names, etc.

Even the current system was not perfect, we missed out on phone numbers during attendance, and some wrong people were added because sometimes we relied on only WhatsApp numbers names that they put, and messed up with the people who put names like ~.

And even I messed up by adding the wrong people multiple times. System errors are real.

  
basement seminar hall hard to find and easy to confuse, also remember to specify rr campus vs ec campus

Absolutely never input directly into excel, very easy to mess up, when you start inputting data after scrolling far right, you'll miss the person's name and input data into someone else's name entirely, it's very easy for people to put data in the wrong pages, annoying to create a page for everyday and maintain it because people might not click the new page and may just fill the page that opens up to them.

Your organizing team will have flawed incapable actors, who don't use excel properly, find a way to minimize their fuckups (like google forms with compulsory questions)

  
 srijan, definitely talk about making sure that one set of people preps while the other debates. If a fellow senior adj will take 10 more minutes to show up, make sure that you get a party started with prep so that the delay of this adj is handled smoothly with no inconvenience to the recruits.

Why no win loss announcing in round 2

  

Also it's important to alleviate anxiety, and make people associate good feelings with the soc. Make it very very clear that there's no winner and loser

  

Explain the 3 motions, don't let teams be clueless, it's fine if you're giving them information.

  

motion ranking good because of illusion of agency

  

make sure case prep is balanced, and make sure it isn't one person talking over 2 other shy people.

  

Keeping friends together in debates. Some people don't keep them together to encourage socialization with new people. I think it's also good to keep them together to increase the fun they have in debate. However what's bad is keeping 2 friends and one stranger in a team which will alienate the stranger.



General comments about each speaker are nice, but they're too much work for an organizer who is going through around 12 people per day. Better in round 1 than round 2.


  
  
scheduling, pains of us attending more sessions than recruits themselves
  
  

Lateral entry people are very important, make sure they know they're allowed, and also helps a lot to keep sessions alive during downtime

  
  
  
  last day of recruitments, meme day,
  you can also see how comfortable juniors have gotten with you, if they shit on you the way you've told them to.
  

# Inside a session
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Session Concepts
Many factors go into ensuring the quality of experience of a debate session.
Debate is an extreme sport, and half the people are going to feel sad at the end of a session. Sadness cannot be avoided, only minimized.

Debate is weird and often an acquired taste. I believe that it takes quite a while to get a feel for debate before you fall in love with it for what it is, rather than what you thought it would be. So, hooking in people to come for the initial sessions in the short term, to push them towards the love point is crucial. (This love point is usually the point where your brain gains 'debate vision', and you start to understand what goes on in a debate).
For this purpose, I think it's justified to paint an incomplete picture of debate and slowly nurture people before you hit them with the brutality.

What I mean by this is:
- not dropping finance and IR (International Relations) motions in the early days.
- Even within other subjects, giving easy and accessible motions (and motions they would find fun). Feeling hopeless and having nothing to say before a speech is quite depressing. 
- Although we know that nearly all motions are balanced, freshers often think most motions are unbalanced. Give them easy motions which even they will think are balanced.
- Unfortunately philosophy motions are usually fun, but usually follow the format of, "THW use this amazing technology", and feel unbalanced for opp because:
- + Freshers feel lost thinking of an opp case cuz the benefits look great and they don't know how to outweigh.
- + beginners don't think about regulation, mismanagement, and long term consequences.
- + so even if there is tremendous learning potential after the round, people can feel depressed during the round.
- not being brutally honest and telling speakers their speeches were shit in the early days.
- spending extra time and effort in the early days compared to later days, providing aftercare to the wounded recruits.
- being generous with prep time so that they build their confidence and lessen their anxiety. We don't need to make them tournament-ready until later.
- **Before every debate have a short speech where you say that verdict doesn't matter, growth is important, and what matters is that they enjoy it.** Because even if this is common knowledge, I believe this needs to be drilled into the heads of freshers so that they are in the right headspace. I did this throughout round 3, and post round 3 it probably isn't that required cause they're used to it.

If you're reading this, you would have already faced the grueling learning curve of being humbled over and over. I believe that if the extremely challenging parts of the learning curve are exposed to people too early, they wouldn't have the love-fueled commitment to persevere through the hardship.
- I know this might look like treating juniors like snowflakes, but debating gets sad, even I and some friends I know still get sad on the regular. Having someone show empathy to you can mean the world to you.
- + _Sure, the argument against this is that if you keep protecting them, they'll never be able to stand on their own two feet._
- But I disagree, regardless of how much their wounds are bandaged by you, getting the wounds frequently makes them stronger naturally with time.
- + _The other argument is to just follow natural selection so that you end up quickly with the debaters who had the most mettle to begin with. But I believe people can grow mettle over time (with your care), and you're leaving these people out if you just let them end themselves._
- + From personal experience, I and a few other people would have quit debating early if we felt like we were inherently too dumb for this shit. So try to effectively balance humbling, learning, and happiness, to keep them coming until they're ready to face hard mode. 
- Keeping it challenging but making people feel like they were able to contribute something significant is key.
- **Love for debate can't really be tested from day one.**


## Time
From the feedback forms and personal experience, the single biggest deterrent of attending debate sessions is time. 
![idle time](https://i.ibb.co/F47qvtxK/idle-time.png)

Having to sit idle before a debate starts significantly impacts the quality of experience of the session for a junior. The delay stretches in their head and contributes to a belief of debate being a waste of time. 
Multiple different delays add up, and they should be minimized.
- Often in 2023, juniors would show up to sessions before seniors, and then ask on Whatsapp where the seniors were. This was extremely optically bad for seniors to look 'unserious' and uncaring of juniors and debate.
- making 1 person wait for 5 more people to show up before starting AP prep is a massive delay for the first person, even if they consent when asked, "Are you okay waiting a bit for 5 people?"
- In 2023, after juniors had shown up, the seniors would still take quite some time to choose a suitable motion for juniors. A lot of time was taken to filter a motion because they also needed to not give juniors motions which they didn't understand. 

The obvious solutions to this are:
1. Do whatever it takes to show up as early as possible or have someone there to get things going.
2. **Start prep time even when you have only 2 or 3 people, even if you expect more people to come. This is okay because**
 + You can't always rely on the people who voted to arrive, and this could result in waiting unnecessarily for nobody.
+ Having extra prep time isn't much of a harm, at least people don't feel like they're sitting idle since they're doing all they can to come up with a case.
+ You can inform the juniors that they will be ironing, and can replace iron slots with other people if they show up.
 + People who come early deserve to get the extra prep time, maybe this will incentivize latecomers to also put extra effort.
 + Prep time isn't as valuable to whips anyway, since their content majorly depends on what is said during the debate. People who come just before the debate is supposed to start, can be whips if slots are open.
 + You can choose to either shorten the total prep time, or have the initial prep time as a bonus, depending on how late it's already gotten.
 + Making latecomers adj can be problematic to how adjing is treated and the narrative that propagates. [Be careful about the narrative you build around adjudication](#the-adj-narrative)
3. **Have a list of motions made in your free time before the session, so that you're not actively wasting time during the session.**

Here are the motions I used in 2024-2025.
[Motion list](#motion-list)
 They were curated to fit the motion criteria talked about earlier this chapter. I have cut out around 30 motions I had initially thought were good, but ended up leading to messy debates, showing they were bad motions.
So all the motions here have been tested and I have witnessed the debates that ensued from these motions.
Feel free to reuse these motions or compile new ones.


I had prioritized parenting, education, and romance motions, but the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059) shows that people soon got bored of these motions and wanted different ones too.
![From the Google Form](https://i.ibb.co/fd1q7Tyk/motionpref.png)
- There are also oddballs who want finance and IR motions, and these people usually get sidelined in the interest of keeping the motions debatable for everyone.
But you can consider occasionally catering to these people (I should have).




Since debates usually involve 6-8 freshers and 1 senior, what naturally happens is that the senior methodically conducts the debate, then the debate ends and people go home. This is the default state that seniors have too.
- Debate feels like a college class where you're one random person lost among the masses.
- I think the most important principle to keep in mind as a senior, is to **give individual attention to every participant**. 
- Not everyone approaches you themselves to ask for personal feedback, so you need to find a way to have one on one interactions with everyone.
- Make people feel valued, make people feel that they made a difference by being there. Because very often people do feel left out and feel like they don't belong.
- Everyone belongs, so make sure they do feel that they belong.
- The one-on-one interaction could be about anything, doesn't have to be about feedback on their speech, but whatever they feel about everything.
- Having ties to the community is what really fosters loyalty and makes people excited to come to the Debsoc.


You will be quite busy as an organizer and a judge, and when OA preparation time consumes you, it's hard to give people individual attention.
At that moment, it's very important to tell at least people, to cross over, shake hands, and chill. 
- It's detrimental if people are sitting in their own seats scrolling their phones during your OA prep time. 
- When people cross over, conversation on the debate usually gets going. There are unresponded POIs and other thoughts on the debate that people are often bursting to say.
- This initial conversation gets the community vibe started, and freshers usually carry the conversation themselves after that.
- It's very important to give the initial push for them to cross over after the debate if they don't.


##  Feedback

Feedback is often tricky when your brain has shut down after the debate and you try to make up something from your own notes.
I personally write down my feedback while the speeches are going on. The moment a question comes to my mind during the speech like, "Missing reasoning", I write it down in brackets. It helps me deliver the feedback quicker when I'm asked for it.

Ideally the judges who conduct sessions are ones who've read and understood the manual, so that 
- Their feedback is far more likely to be valid.
- Reading the manual also gives the judge conviction behind their feedback because they know it to be correct, rather than saying, "I'm not sure about this but I don't think you're allowed to edit your model in the second speech".
- Wrong feedback can set debaters back quite a bit because they approach future debates believing this is right, and also ignore tourney adjes who contradict this feedback because "these tourney adjes don't know what they're talking about". So they may never realize their mistake.

**The impulsive way to give feedback is telling people how they messed up and what they can improve on.
But I think you should consciously try to tell people what they got right as well for a few reasons.**
- Freshers often do random genius stuff they weren't taught to do, like weighing sometimes. Give them a signal that this is something good which they should keep going. 
- If juniors just change their approach constantly, they won't really know what to keep.
- Just like tournaments, speakers feel understood and cared for when their ideas were received by the judge. The more positive emotions people associate with the debsoc, the more they'll want to keep coming.
- From the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059), something juniors feel is, "I'm working hard in debate everyday but get the same brutal feedback all the time, am I just unable to grow at all? Is there any point to this?"
![image](https://i.ibb.co/27VvCzRf/feedback-reaction.png)
- They're already getting humbled by other factors, we don't want them to get humbled to the point where they quit.
- "You got so far doing this right, you just need to tweak the last bit of delivery" is quite motivational for someone to hear, balancing happiness and motivation to grow.

(I personally didn't follow this as well as I should have, and consciously gave positive advice only a small portion of the time. I should have done it more, but was too much in the zone of 'constructive criticism'.)

A great way to give feedback to debaters, is to **ask them questions about their case** like, "Why do you think this is true?", and once they answer, say, "This is good reasoning which should have come out in your speech". 
This solves 2 problems. 
1. If you gave regular feedback, it might feel wrong to them (like they disagree with you, but they won't push you more on it)
2. Your feedback won't feel obvious to them like, "speak your sentence clearer".
3. More importantly, it makes them feel good about themselves since it came out of their own mouth, and makes them realize it isn't an inherent IQ issue but a presentation issue.

I believe speaker scores should not be given in mocks.
- Speaker scores are such a scam, different judges give different speaker scores, and brackets are also unclear and judges may not know, "how relevant is 'frequently relevant',".
- At least with feedback you can give everyone feedback and criticize them all. With public speaker scores, there's an 'objective' hierarchy of who is the worst debater in the room, the second worst etc. (at least in the eyes of an average fresher).
- There's no real benefit of 'extra motivation to grind' when you give people speaker scores.
- When they've already had a bad day, shit speaks can further mess them up. 
- The argument against this is, "omg they won't know how speaker scores work in real tournaments then", but the harms outweigh the benefits. It's not really important to know how speakers scores work at tournaments unless you're a judge.
- Another argument is that people can track their progress, but speaker scores are quite stagnant since the realistic range is so small. This can give the illusion of a lack of progress.


## Balancing
Once you know the skill levels of people, you can occasionally match up teammates to make the debate 'balanced'.
- Losing debates nonstop will get to anyone. Even the 'weakest' debater is a valuable member of the soc, and their self-esteem needs to be kept high enough to be motivated to come to sessions. Even if they feel trash, they shouldn't further feel like utter trash. (In fact a weak debater is a vulnerable stakeholder, and if you're not able to uplift those who work hard, then it's a skill issue of the Debsoc).
- So stealthily teaming them up with debaters you think are good, keeps the debates close and exciting too.
- This also gives all debaters experience in working with different kinds of people.


## Keeping it fun

Debate can get boring fast until you've stayed long enough to acquire the taste. 
Sprinkle in stuff like Harry Potter motions, PES related motions (carefully), the sugar daddy motion (Motion 39 over [here](#motion-list)).
- This leads to more fun, laughter, and people feeling that the soc is a place they can have a great time in.
- Being informal and saying weird stuff makes people get more open and comfortable with each other.

There isn't much 'risk'.
- People won't straight up complain to the PES management about this. 
- It can't be sensational enough for a mass forward unless there's a video recording or something, and that's easily preventable.
- The worst that could happen is people joking about it with their friends from out of debsoc, and that's just free marketing.
- Through many debates people already know that the debsoc usually debates serious topics, so this won't make the entire soc look unserious.
- Even if the motion ends up in the hands of PES management, they wouldn't care enough to give serious consequences. Our feminism motions about sex positivity and regretting the stigmatization of hookup culture are riskier.

#### Turncoat
When there have been 2 or 3 people showing up for a session (like it often happens in odd sems before recruitments), we have played Turncoat with each other. A prompt is given, a person speaks, and every time the prompter claps their hands, the speaker has to switch sides. Sometimes we have fun prompts too like someone's feelings about her microbiology professor, and Bharath's experience conducting PESDT.
It is still well aligned in the direction of sharpening your debate skills, and is super fun because of how quick witted you have to be when changing.

#### Alley Debating
I spoke to a few debate prodigies from Aditi Mallya (the two girls who were runners up at PESDT in 2024), and they told me about Alley debating. We've implemented it twice in debsoc sessions.
The way it works is that everyone goes to the podium and stands in 2 lines of 3 people each. It works like an AP with no prep time, no POIs, and 1-minute speeches per person. We would pass the phone which held the timer like a baton from speaker to speaker. Every speech had to be some sort of an extension like BP.
It was fun cuz of how goofy it was, and very time efficient too.


#### Impromptu debates
Pretty straightforward. Especially good when there are like 2 people for a session. No prep time, the motion drops and the PM just starts yapping. (The LO technically gets 7 minutes prep time). For more people this format isn't as impactful because they don't feel the time crunch as much.
It's a good way to keep you on your feet and make you better prepared for tourney time crunches.

### Online Sessions
At the beginning of his clubhead term, Nikhil and I walked around during breaks and asked random 2nd years about how they felt about clubs. A surprising number of them said that the factor keeping them away from clubs was accessibility, because they had to travel home and couldn't stay at PES. They wished there were more online activities by clubs.

While Nikhil and I understood this exclusive benefit, we're still certified haters of online sessions.
- The community aspect doesn't feel natural because someone has to initiate conversation during OA prep time (and the responsible senior is usually busy prepping their OA).
- Without being able to see each other, conversation quickly turns awkward.
- People talk over each other each other making everything more awkward.
- It's easy to become depressed post your debate because you're all alone (happens to me often).
- The impressions of people aren't that impactful.
- Conversation between the seniors and juniors often ends after the OA/feedback. You have to consciously initiate further conversation. However offline, conversation would happen naturally on the way to the gate.
- Nobody really leaves an impression, you can't often remember debating alongside someone if they were just a name on your screen.
- People either forget about the session, or join really late because there are so many things at home that can take up your time. Back in 2022, online sessions set for 9 pm used to start at 10 pm. 
- If someone starts off debating with online sessions, they might drop out because they're unaware that online sessions are far inferior to the fun of offline sessions.

However since you can access a few people who are online-only, it's recommended to do at least one online session a week for these people who don't wish to come offline. Preferably a Friday or Saturday.
Even if they don't practice body language and the feeling of speaking to a physical audience which are useful for tournaments, they're still tournament-ready for online tournaments.

The closest I've been to quitting debate was after an online debate. I quit the call entirely. 
It means the world to people if you dm them and check up on them and how they feel about the session. (easier if you weren't involved in the session). 


  ## A few issues of sessions that persist

a) Dividing the workload:

Every year we try hard to encourage people to come, and people do 'commit' in theory. 
But it always looks like people lack the push to actually show up.
We have had seniors take up voluntary adjing slots using an excel sheet before, but people would often forget, or not feel obligated enough to write their name themselves.

I don't know if this is due to bystander effect because there seems to be someone already conducting the session. 
But even if there already is someone, **more seniors are always needed.**
- The person who 'conducts' the session usually ends up judging, but this can tire them out. Taking over their judging shifts and letting them speak gives them time to refresh.
- When I spoke to Akshat Saxena, I realized that pro-ams are one of the most crucial ways to speed track debate progress. Because matter sessions aren't enough if both participants don't actively work on the same case together. Pro-ams help juniors understand what the right debate habits are. 
- Case prep with a senior you've teamed up with by itself is an incredible learning experience, and a very cool fascinating experience for the juniors that I've spoken to.
- Having too many seniors is always better than having too less seniors. In the worst case if you have a debate room full of juniors, and 2 extra seniors, these seniors can always at least guide the case prep of the juniors and cheer them on, even if they don't speak themselves.


 
Senior judge: junior participant ratio is a big deal. Often the debsoc doesn't even have 1 available senior for 6 juniors. Early on there are often too many juniors. One way to combat this is having more seniors. Another way is spreading out sessions even more (scheduling sessions according to the availability of the seniors rather than juniors), such that the juniors are spread out across different sessions, but the senior is available to repeat sessions.

When more than a room full of juniors pull up, there are a few ways to adjust it.
You can make the extra person adj a handful of times, but make sure they don't feel like they didn't matter. Even if it's AP, do deliberation with them and ask them questions, make them feel like they're exercising their debate muscle. 

When we had 8 people pull up to a session before we taught them BPs, I made one of them a fake reply speaker once. Basically a 4th person gave a 4 minute speech as a reply speech. When there were 7 people, there was a reply speaker from one side but not the other side, we just worked around with what we had.

b) Another issue is the complications of adjing. It was initially a subsection under "Inside a Session", but my rant grew longer and longer.

### My Story
The debsoc controversy I am the most infamous for is my history with Adjudication.
This was before CUPD 2023, my first tournament. My seniors put up a poll for speakers and adjudicators, and naturally everyone from my batch including me voted for speaking. 
2 weeks before the tournament, there were 4 of us who were still unsorted into the slots we had paid for. Our seniors were getting increasingly frustrated with us telling us, "How have you not decided your roles amongst yourselves yet?". 
As we were all freshers to the debsoc, I expected our seniors to assign roles for us, since most of us hadn't been to a tournament before, but they seemed to avoid that responsibility. (I believe this is another underlying issue with the way we approach tournaments, giving 'freedom' without it really being freedom, and just leaving us clueless since there's no authority to back up a decision.)
The 4 of us continued to avoid discussion about which 3 would form a team and which one would adj.
In an attempt to reach a decision, I texted, "Who wants to adj?", and nobody responded. 
Anyway my seniors saw it and the next debate session I was ripped apart. I said that since adjing was undesirable for everyone, they should have a fair system to select the adj, possibly spinning a wheel.
I got told off for dissing on adjing and getting defensive (which is valid, I was), and was told that I'd be the adj (who saw this coming am I right). 
I had never been told that judges competed too, so I felt even more useless.
Being a forced adj for CUPD didn't get me to like adjing either.
For those who know me, things changed eventually, and I ended up adjing 3x more debates than I've spoken in.
Anyway, this highlights a couple problems with adjing.

### Adjing Obstacles

1. Adjing is seen as more undesirable than speaking by the vast majority of the circuit, as seen from
- The constant requests on mixidea and 4crossmock where speaker slots have been filled up fast but nobody wants to voluntarily adj.
- The constant adj scarcity in tournaments and begging to OC to waive off adj slots, or begging to juniors to adj.
2. If someone's adjing out of obligation, it's hard to set up a system of rotating adjes to be 'fair' with carrying the burden of adjing. (As you can guess, this also negatively warps the [narrative of adjing](#the-adj-narrative)).
3. Adjing tournaments can disappoint freshers due to a multitude of reasons like 
- They spent most of their time in the debsoc speaking, and aren't trained to do this.
- They're likely to spend the whole tournament as a trainee, and hence speakers scroll their phones during their OA and don't take them seriously, people go to ask the chair feedback instead of them, and they feel they have no impact on the tournament because their vote doesn't matter. They don't get any numerical result from the tournament either.
- Same things for BP except that they do a lot of boring work to track 4 teams, and only have 60 seconds to make a case, so they don't get the thrill of standing and giving a speech either.
- There's so much fun in debate with a teammate, and as an adj you feel lonely. At every room, there won't be any PES friends. 
 - There's no real opportunity to talk to anyone either. You have your lunch during speaker case prep, and speakers get to chill with each other when you're preparing your OA.
 - Adjing is boring and challenging with no real payoff.
4. At the CUPD that I spoke about, there were 4 teams with seniors, 1 team from us freshers, 1 senior adj, and 4 junior adjes, which shows that my seniors essentially 'used' us freshers to carry the burden of adjing so that they could enjoy the speaking slots that we opened up for them.
5. My seniors believed that freshers should compulsorily adj their first tournament. I think this is a good concept, but the main issues are:
- There are a dozen freshers in their first tournament, it doesn't make sense to make all of them adj.
- The point of the initial tournament is to give juniors an experience so fun and insightful that juniors will want to continue debating and doing tournaments. And even if the grueling work of adjing 'builds character', they may not want to ever do a tournament again.
6. You usually can't go to a tournament as 6 speakers and no adj. So even if one person is a usual designated adj, who's gonna adj and earn this person a speaking slot when they want to speak? 

_One initial solution I had thought of a year ago, was to make people adj once every three or four tournaments._
- _This number was chosen because contingents usually can afford twice or thrice the number of speakers than adjes, and mathematically the ratios match when people switch roles across tournaments._
- _Freshers can speak in their first two tournaments, and this will be enough for them to not quit even if their adjing experience sucks._ 
- _This also distributes adjes evenly among multiple tournaments._
- However, later I realized this was bad for the [narrative of adjing](#the-adj-narrative). (The only way to still execute this is equally say that _speaking_ twice in 3 tourneys is also 'compulsory', but this is too delicate and weird, and one slip-up ruins the narrative of adjing).
6. Freshers can't really adj during round 1 round 2 recruitments because they don't know what to judge, or how to analyze clashes. The thrill of speaking is way more than the thrill of adjing, so to bait them into the debsoc the initially need to speak.
7. How do you get them to switch to adjing if they have gotten used to speaking?


## The Adj Narrative

### Characterization

==**Be careful with all your words to not propagate a negative narrative of adjing.**==
From the way my CUPD lore went down, it was clear that my bad impression of adjing just became worse. So most variations of 'compulsory' adjing are likely to be destructive. 


The ideal scenario to get them to switch to adjing is that they wanna try something new, try adjing, and end up liking it. The ideal scenario is people voluntarily adj in tournaments and push through all the sad parts. The Debsoc in 2023 was blessed to have multiple people voluntarily passionately adj tournaments, removing one of the biggest burdens of tournaments. I had never seen this phenomenon in my 2 years of debate till then, and slightly hold the belief that this happened due to random chance.


How do we make sure this trend continues?
- Already having the trend is a good start. My seniors lacking adjes, and avoiding adjing themselves pushed the narrative that adjing was undesirable for me. Currently there is a trend of debsoc seniors voluntarily judging, which is nice and makes it look desirable.
- The target audience of people who will like adjing more than speaking, needs to be aware of the full benefits of adjing. What are the reasons these people get into adjing in the first place?
- + I know someone who got into adjing because they were too afraid to speak.
- + I know someone who judges when they're too exhausted to speak.
- + I know people who end up judging all the time because they're late all the time.
- + I know people who equally feel like judging/speaking, and because they're the only one among 7 people who feel that way, they're made a judge.
- + People may feel to pressured to give a speech, and are too used to having no case due to no knowledge of the world, and judging seems more comfortable because you're given the content. (A major reason I prefer judging)
- + Some more positive reasons to judge are because people like the way their brain is use during judging, and how challenging it is.
- + **The interesting thing about the narrative of freshers early on before they judge, is that judging looks like a position of authority.** Freshers believe that you need to be highly qualified to be a judge, and that being a judge is a sign of you being great (They're unaware that anyone can judge in a tournament). 
- I don't know how exactly to encourage adjing (because if you start outright telling everyone 'adjing is nice, do try it out', it looks like you're a scamster. Anything that is actually good doesn't need explicit endorsement.) I have a few [ideas](#elevating-the-judging-experience) on how you can increase a fresher's enjoyment of judging mocks. 
- But what is definitely important, is avoiding discouraging adjing. Members of the debsoc have often made statements which ruin the narrative of adjing (me included), and we need to be careful.

Samuel, my senior, once said this to encourage judging,

"Also, I notice a lot of you love speaking and I couldn't be glader you're all eager to debate. However do note that Adjudication/Judging is equally important for the following reasons:
1) Adjudicating is also a competition in tournaments, and speakers rate you on your Oral Adjudication (OA).
2) It's easier to break (qualify to playoffs), as an adjudicator than a speaker.
3) The prize money for adjes is obscene - 10-20k ez for best adjes at big tournaments.
4) Adjing makes you a better debater, because you analyse the debate from a neutral perspective and have to do all aspects from framing to weighing, making you well rounded.
5) It's a great way to get rep in the circuit and become highly respected. A lot of career adjes are some of the most respected people in the circuit.
All in all, try and balance the both when you come for practice, that way you become a more well rounded debater. Cheers :)"

The way he carefully did it was by knowing that at the time people didn't judge because they hadn't even tried it out, and he was encouraging them to try it out, which was a smart move.
**I think it's very important to inform people that judges also compete at tournaments, because we don't consciously inform this to new recruits, and recruits also never expect that judges compete as well, so they're usually ignorant of this fact. This information makes people care about becoming better judges, and shows that judging is a challenge worth pursuing.** (if new debaters don't know that judges compete, then why would they want to register as an adj at a tournament).

However, a few issues from Sam's text are
- "easier to break" isn't necessarily true, and I'm unsure about the messaging that people should try it because it's easy.
- The judge prize money isn't that accurately portrayed, and that feels like a speculative impact to a lot of people.
- Sam missed out on all the benefits IAs and SAs get. If you want to market judging financially to people, **tell them about how colleges in Bangalore like NLS and Christ pay people, quite ordinary SA level people to come judge for them.** I got 5k once to judge NLS (Even though I have never broken at a tournament) and I was super happy about judging.
- A fundamental issue is that people may wonder why there is even pressure put on them to judge, because if judging is actually fun, everybody should be trying to do it. Maybe people don't think so deep. Luckily this isn't a real problem with Samuel's context of, "making people aware of something they've never tried out", but while trying to convince people to judge, you replicate this text, some nuances may be missed and it might not work out.


### Common Pitfalls

**Trends get pushed in micro ways, and try to avoid being a perpetuator as much as you can** 
- One of my seniors once was coming to a session after a long time, and when I asked them to adj, they replied, "I'm not coming to a session after so long to _adj_".

- Making people judge when they come late seems like a 'punishment'. When they show up as the 7th person, they might say something like, "Aw man, I'm judging today?!", and we might be too tempted to say, "If you want to speak, then come earlier next time", an an effort to make them punctual. 
- Even actions with positive intent can be destructive. Profusely thanking someone for agreeing to your judge can be destructive ("Thank you so so so much for making a huge sacrifice and agreeing to judge my mock/judge for this tournament"), because they further the narrative that adjing is undesirable.
- If you have a strict bar for people to participate in tourneys (inactive people cannot come to tourneys), you might be tempted to lower the bar for someone who wants to adj, saying, "We really need an adj, we'll take you to Bombay with us even if you have been inactive", which further pushes that adjing is undesirable.
- Page 38 and 40 of the book I mentioned earlier, [Empowering University Debate Clubs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAni64_JD4Uu6N00kryFs0j_W7q1Heeb/view) puts it into words better than I ever can. (Page 38 is about the difficult task of getting seniors to judge juniors, which I'd recommend checking out. Here are some very relevant excerpts from page 40.
- - Sometimes societies struggle with finding people willing to judge and opt for a rotating system. This usually enforces an obligation to judge one time per three to four debates. This system is good for egalitarian treatment and makes sure no one feels like they are being pressured into judging too much. In small societies with just a few qualified judges, this system-approach allows for new people to quickly get into judging. The advice would be to ask the good judges to chair the first few months with different new people as wings before going fully into the system to keep the judging level consistent. However, this system can make judging seem like “a chore” to earn “the reward” of debate. It forces people to keep track of how many people have debated and can decrease judging quality if a big pool of novices is involved. A hybrid system of rotating systems (rather informally) and encouraging narratives and activities can prevent the cons of this approach.
> Furthermore, it should be emphasized that judging is just a part of debating and it is a great opportunity to provide feedback to help your friends and fellow debaters improve. Rather than seeing it as an act of service, it should be presented as a given, not to create narratives of judging being a “duty” and debating a “reward”.

Although this is idealistic and nice in principle, it's hard to really implement this and ensure that such narratives are created exactly the way we wish. "Presented as a given" sounds a lot like, "compulsory".

### Elevating The Judging Experience
Adjudication only started to really feel fulfilling to me when I felt the value I was providing.
- I was the sole third year student holding sessions, and I felt valued since sessions couldn't run without me.
- I wasn't a 'useless trainee' judge anymore, but a chair who people depended on.
- I felt this 'value' when juniors asked me for feedback on getting better. It made me feel like I was the shit, the man.

How do we get inexperienced juniors to enjoy judging though? Since they are not fully qualified to give feedback.
The two scenarios a junior would be judging is 
1. As a panel to a senior chair
2. As a chair, a sole judge, when the senior present decides to speak instead.

I think there are primarily 2 ways to replicate a portion of this feeling that I had, and it's the duty of the senior present to try.
1. **If you're the chair, make the junior feel like their thoughts are heard.** 
2. **If you spoke, ask this junior judge for feedback. Most people don't think of this because they think there's no point of doing this. However, it can still help you to know how an ordinary person would interpret your speech. And it does leagues of improvement in the enjoyment of a junior to judge, because they feel proud about their opinion being valued by a senior. They might say things like, "I don't know how to judge, this is my first time, don't ask me", but get it out of them, saying that you value their words, you value the fact that they sat through your 1 hour yap.**

Speakers rarely feel like they didn't matter, because people pay attention to their words, and their words are talked about in the OA. Trainees however often feel like they didn't matter. Make sure they enjoy judging, and make sure they feel that they're contributing, and they matter. 

_However, I wouldn't recommend getting the fresher to give an OA to everyone because people might follow incorrect advice from them. What I did, was ask this panelist to give their OA privately to me. 
However, if you think you can interrupt their OA and catch them on every mistake or misleading piece of feedback, and prevent harm to the other fresher speakers, then go for public OAs. 
However, interrupting is annoying, and you might make a mental note of their mistakes and tell them later, but in this case you're also quite likely to forget your mental notes._

## Push to come to sessions

The question the debsoc will forever grapple with is, "How do we get people to come to sessions?"

Being strict works in getting people to work at school because you're forced to come anyway. Being strict in the debsoc and causing bad vibes just pushes people to avoid it all.
The stance my seniors adopted in 2022 was one involving fear. Everyone was supposed to vote on the poll (Actually fill a google form because Whatsapp didn't have the poll feature at the time), and DM one of the heads with a very valid reason if they were missing out on that session. 
One time our debate knowledge was tested. And we got shit on for not knowing the full form of THP even after a year in the club. 
When numbers of attendees dropped, we were called to serious meetings where we were yelled at. The constant threat was that if we weren't attending enough sessions, we'd be kicked out of the club. 

At the time I was apathetic about late night online sessions, and I adopted the stance of, "Oh if they want to kick me out so badly, I'm fine getting kicked if they remember to do it".

Fear isn't a great motivator especially when the consequence is the direction they're heading towards anyway. This 'punishment' intuitively doesn't make sense because why would people want to be in a club without enjoying the activity and wanting to participate in the core activity of the club? (The intuitive assumption is that anyone who cares about being in the club would also care enough to attend debates, because that's the point).
By the way, there are a few possible answers to this question actually
1. It's in the back of their mind, and they always think about coming, but they never bring themselves to come. Other things take priority.
2. They want to be in a club for the sake of it, because it's cool. (There are people who get excited over buying debsoc merch even though they don't debate anymore and even feel like even a part of the club). 
3. They have issues on weekdays but not weekends.
4. They want to do tournaments because they are super fun, but don't want to attend sessions because they're not that fun. (Surprisingly a very common scenario I've observed).

It's hard to really solve these problems, the best you can do is things like Cubbon sessions, and also keep the value of sessions high.

- A lot of people, in their head, will feel guilty about coming to debate, because 'they should be studying instead', 'they could have been studying instead'. People always imagine that if they got 2 hours extra in a day, they would spend those hours studying. Even if people actually end up passing the time anyway on their short days, the fantasy of this is enough to deter people from walking to a debate session. 
- Nobody thinks that debating is more productive than studying, regardless of how much debating adds value to your life. Second year onwards, the main reason people would come is because of the community. People should be _tempted_ to come debate. 
- The only reason college students do anything besides studies, is when something feels fun, or if it's what people picturized themselves doing in their college life. People may come to debate sessions because it helps them pursue their dream of, "having a fun college life", the way that people hang out with their friends regardless of their academic commitments.

The activity of the debsoc should be kept fresh in the minds of even the people who don't come to debate. Just seeing a poll everyday doesn't give even me a feel of the club being lively, and debating.
Share the motion on the WhatsApp group (not the Sessions group because that prevents free-flowing conversation since people cannot reply to it), share random fun pictures of the people at the session, maybe share the names of the people at the session if there are quite a few people. It really makes people feel the fear of missing out, the feel that there's something thriving which other people are enjoying, which they are not a part of.

One thing that Akshat Saxena once told me was that to ignite passion in the juniors, the seniors must also show their passion and how much they have the obsession to debate. This shows that debate is something people find fun enough, valuable enough, to spend their time in, even when they have other priorities. Seeing other people with an opinion of debate being valuable makes juniors feel like the right opinion, the normal opinion, the socially validated opinion is to also enjoy debate. On the flip side seniors avoiding sessions pushes the narrative that, "Debate is something everyone stops eventually", and making something feel temporary gives less reason for a junior to invest time and energy to work towards a long term debate goal.

Inertia is huge, don't let people go too long without debating. People get comfortable with patterns and routines. Try to have some debate scene in vacations, like online sessions or Cubbon park, and try to start debating the moment a new academic semester starts. The first 2 weeks are crucial to break the inertia, because once assignments start rolling in, it's really hard to break the routine of 'not debating'. On the flip side if people have started debating every Tuesday and Wednesday, people usually continue it.

If you have successfully made juniors believe that tournaments are fun as hell, and if you really need an external motivator to get people to come to sessions, then tournaments work well as your carrot. Only allowing people who consistently show up is the only real incentive, the only real power you can wield over people to incentivize them to act the way you want them to. (well you can withhold Debsoc merchandise too I suppose). This also makes the reward feel valuable to someone since they earned it, they were chosen for this slot because of their dedication to the soc. As long as this threat is followed upon, it remains as an incentive since tournaments are constant through the year, and being prevented from one tournament isn't permanent because you can earn your reward for the next tournament.
The issue is that this makes debsoc sessions look like a chore, but at least people will come to a session and then remember how fun sessions are. (Like some people who experience the thrill of solving an academic question, but still procrastinate starting to solve the questions). It also makes people feel like they're working towards something, every session is bringing them closer to a tournament.

(We did this occasionally and made it such that if you didn't qualify for a tournament but really wanted to come, you could pay out of your own pocket. The debsoc didn't owe you money because you weren't really a contributing member to the soc, you didn't assist in its activity through sessions.)

## Informal recruitments


Heavily encourage spectators, a lot of people find it easier to opt in, both already recruits and future people


Also give a few reasons on why we should allow lateral entry people, like reduces the load, helps us get more members for sessions temporarily at least. 
Hook people into debate (like first years who are newly second years, who want to join cuz their friend is in the debsoc a lot) before their academic load starts during recruitment season.








we used to make everyone vote on the poll, even if it was a no. But it might be bad for optics to have many nos.



A good way to make people feel valued is to remember them by their name and call them by their name, make some reference to a thing they had said on a previous day, etc etc



Put extra effort to talk to everyone so that they don't feel like they're part of an 'outgroup'.



don't alienate mun people because a lot of people try out both clubs. take the high road, don't turn off people by spewing mun hate. Even if I didn't like mun, I'd lose respect for a debsoc member who needed to hate on mun to make debate look valuable.



## Tournaments

  freeloaders need to be banned. It's awkward, but you need to stand your ground.
  
Especially in tourneys, ask questions about rounds, constantly acknowledge their existence, judging feels really lonely otherwise



Tourney reg, assign teams yourself, ask participants to reg, not as 'speakers' or 'judges', and later assign yourself based on what you see

 glorification of people who break




Talk about how you succeed and get soc loyalty at the point where the person, "Sees themself as a debater"

a lot of people who stay in debsoc are friendless otherwise, so the community and friendship really does mean a lot to them



## Miscellaneous
### Teaching debate
For the love of god, there are better motions than THW legalize weed to use as an example when teaching debate. 
However when asked to pick a random motion to demonstrate a concept, this is the first motion that comes to mind. (Please have more relevant motions at hand before you start a matter session).
- Most freshers don't know about the system of the black market, or the psychologies of druggies, so a drug debate can feel disconnected.
- So when you teach mech and impacting it, it doesn't feel as real. If you used a parenting motion, children could easily understand mech and impacting when they relate to it.
- Even flipping is easy to understand in a parenting motion, saying that constant reminders to study make you less studious.

The counter arguments I've heard about this are
- It's short and sweet, that's why it comes to mind easily.
- It's more enticing and an "oooooo" topic.
- It's cool to blow people's minds when you make a gov case, cuz they're used to dissing on weed.
- It's a cool demonstration of a flip, saying that banning it makes it worse. 
- "If the first motion I encounter in the soc is something dry like parents and education I might leave"


### Pranks
I support not playing pranks in the initial days because it erodes trust in the clubheads. Especially not pranks like, "you won't get in to debsoc" during the recruitment days. You don't want recruits to associate a feeling of anxiety with the debsoc.
Light fun might also ruin the experience of a few people. But if you can get people smiling and laughing out of it, or convert it into lore, or talk about how you went through the same thing (like the prank to make people wear formals in their first tournament), then it can be beneficial.

### Relatability
Speaking of which,
**It's great to talk about how you went through the same struggles, having a love hate relationship with debate, how your confidence oscillated, how you always forgot impacting, how you used to fumble glorification, narrative, and THR motions too. This empathy is great for them to feel normal and less shit about themselves. We don't always consciously do this, but we should actively try to tell them how we relate to the hardships they're going through now.**


### The damn PES timetable
There are different types of differences in the timetables. 
1. The daily timing which is different for B. Tech and non B.Tech. This is so annoying because if one branch has a majority of people, the minority gets too late for session prep time, or too early (they just leave for home). This causes many of the minority to quit debating. 
And the worst part is that the only way to solve this is to have enough seniors from the minority branch (which won't be the case if many of the minority quit debating the year before), so this is a perpetuating cycle. 
Allowing people to join sessions late does mitigate this but it's really hard to pull this off efficiently, and I don't know how to go about it. You can't always make the latecomers adj. (Refer the section where I spoke about [making latecomers adj](#common-pitfalls))
2. The weekly timing which gives different people different sets of half days. This further distributes the available recruits into different days. What we usually do is take a poll at the start of the semester asking for people to announce their half days, and then choose like 3 days out of these in a week to hold 

talk about how the windows of opportunity to do big things like cubbon sessions or group gatherings are limited because of how students have alternating ISAs, so avoid putting off opportunities hoping for better opportunities in the future.



Talk about whatsapp group chats and why you need an admins only sessions group

Accompanying them will be robots who are comprehensively programmed to develop, raise, protect, and educate these “New Children” once they reach the new planet.

This digital existence is persistent as long as the system supporting it remains functional and as long as others choose to engage with it.
