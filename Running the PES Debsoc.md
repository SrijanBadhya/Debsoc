# This House Would...

Welcome, valued Debsoc core member.

The purpose of this document is to pass on knowledge, to prevent future batches from repeating mistakes, and to make tried-and-tested solutions replicable.
As seniors, it's our responsibility to make you, our juniors, not feel lost about running the club. This document is extensive because I want to make you aware of every incident that can pop up during recruitments and debate sessions.

A lot of these solutions may seem like common knowledge, but I believe it's important that these are pondered and have motivated effort behind their implementation.

- As every coder knows, replacing an existing solution with a different solution can lead to other problems popping up.
- So, every solution I talk about will have reasoning, what it's meant to solve, and its flaws that still persist. Being aware of this reasoning will help you choose the system that's right for you and make more thoughtful changes.
- I believe that every batch will be able to improve upon existing systems.[^1] The ideal is for every change to be a step forward, instead of causing old problems to resurface.
- An ideal change would patch up existing flaws without opening up the flaws covered by old systems. However, trade-offs must be made sometimes, and I trust you to weigh which flaws are worth handling.

[^1]: As of now this will probably be through people making comments on the Dropbox link of this document. I'm unsure how I'll fit their comment onto the Blogger document and credit their name next to their paragraph. I may even shift to github pull requests and possibly eventually pass control on.

**So who am I, and why care about what's written here?**
~~It feels cringe to type this~~
I'm Srijan Badhya, a member of Debate Shenanigans 3.0 (if you still follow that chronological system). I've been a part of around 200 debates with PES Debsoc members across my 4 years. I've helped conduct recruitments for 3 batches and experienced the recruitment for my own batch. I have experienced being under different leaders and have experience trying different forms of leadership myself. I've engaged with dozens of juniors about how they feel in the soc. I've talked to debaters from other colleges about how they believe societies should be run. There are too many people to credit in the making of this book, in fact, they're everyone I've had the honor of meeting across my debate career. 
You can contact me at srijanbadhya@gmail.com or artemisrijan@gmail.com, I'll definitely reply within a week. 

There already exists a globally famous document, [How to Start a Debate Society](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAni64_JD4Uu6N00kryFs0j_W7q1Heeb/view). I thought that it was necessary to have something more tailored to PES, tailored to the state of the PES Debsoc at the moment, and hence I embarked on this project.

<br>

This document is long. I don't want to make you give up the way I gave up halfway through Hadar's matter session on closing (I'm sorry Hadar), ==so this will be the format of the content:==
In true debate fashion, this book will have my claims about what I think a good action to follow is, and what to keep in mind for decisions. 
- If you believe in the claim and decide to implement it, you can skip the reasons and move on. **(try to skip as many bullet points as you can so that you don't lose the will to read this document)**
- If you disagree instead, I implore you to read the reasoning behind the claim. If you're able to take down these reasons with a better claim, a better system, or outweigh them, then you should go ahead with this better claim. 

It does take effort to keep these policies implemented, and I want to be able to convince you that it is worth the effort to implement something rather than believing, "What happens naturally is enough".
I don't want mistakes from the past to repeat because I wasn't able to empower my juniors with functional systems.
I believe it's good to keep in mind the merits and demerits of alternate policies while implementing a particular policy.


The claims will be in **bold** and the reasons will be in bullet points. Alternate systems conceptualized or once followed will be in _italics_. 

**My whole yap isn't to say, "This is what you _should_ follow", but rather to just explain the frontier of my knowledge and lay out my case, hoping that you can overcome limitations, expand the frontier, and make better systems.**

Before we get to the policies, let me first talk about the guiding values which are the basis for all the claims here (what we prioritized in our decisions).

# Guiding Principles

## The Point of a Debate Club
2 parts: Debate, and Club

_There are people who say that the point of a debate club is to debate, and it's bad to chill too much_
I believe chilling is fine, in so far as it aligns with the club's purpose. (there I said it, the first and last time I'll use that debate phrase!!)

The single biggest purpose of a club is to ==provide value to every single member.==


Why do people want to join a club?

- They believe the activity will be enjoyable.
- They believe they'll learn something from the activity.
- They believe they'll be able to hang out with nice fun people.

I will henceforth link all my arguments to these impacts of joy, growth, and community.
I believe a club should not stray away from meeting these 3 needs of its members. 
The needs are heavily disagreed upon, and the methods even more so. 



_**Some have believed that the point of the debate club is to win tournaments and get accolades.**_

- _This does initially make sense since our tournament results are what our PES management gets to see._
- _And the debsoc cares about getting funded by PES because that's how we get to go to more fun tournaments._

**However, some of us believe that if you judge the club solely by its tournament wins, you may lose sight of what matters, and a number of unhealthy behaviors can creep in.**

- To win tournaments, you might start prioritizing your attention towards the people who already show potential and debate skills, to hone them further.
- This could also mean that when you have limited tournament slots or resources, you give them to the people already performing well.
- **A hierarchy forms where people feel like worthless members when they're not the ones bringing in the accolades.**
- - They take tournament losses even more seriously because they're now a disappointment to the soc, not someone the soc is proud to have.
- When a good debater becomes problematic, you're willing to let it slide because they're 'valuable to the soc'.
  + They may continue ruining the debate club experience for everyone else, while still bringing in tournament wins.
  + By utilitarian metrics, this reduces the number of people who enjoy debate and the club, reduces their enjoyment of debate and the club, and hence reduces the breadth and depth of the value given by the club.
- You might get depressed over the Debsoc 'deteriorating' when the people are actually doing fine. They're still enjoying the club and enjoying debate but you're hyperventilating.

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/fd1BYB3t/Whats-App-Image-2025-09-09-at-23-33-50.jpg)
- You might be cringe and hesitate to work with other societies and give good feedback because they're 'rival societies' who are 'taking away your wins'. (For a while I had to process these cringeworthy thoughts in my own head).

**Most of the benefits are accessible even when you don't solely care about tournament wins. You can still achieve joy, growth, and community without grinding solely for tournament wins.**

- In the 2020-2023 timeframe, the PES management still freely provided reimbursement for tourneys, regardless of the lack of breaks we had in quite a few tourneys. **PES seems to fund us to support activity in the club, more than 'bringing PES name and fame', which they enjoy as a side effect, not as the main purpose.**
- A bit of extra seriousness might lead to better 'results', but this can significantly take away from joy and the community, so be careful what extent you're doing it to.
  + **Debating should not feel like studying. People shouldn't feel guilty for not putting in the work. People shouldn't be so turned off by the concept of having to output results that they stop enjoying the activity itself.**

_Some people believe that even having 3 members is enough as long as they're constantly debating and grinding. (The debsoc did reach this point in 2020 I believe.)_
Some of us (including me) believe that being more chill and having more people for fun, is worth it, even if it slows our improvement in debating. 

- A big reason people engage with the debate club is for community, for their friends, for fun with them, so I believe that having enjoyable chill time goes a long way in getting people to stay, and also motivates them to debate more. 
- So this isn't as mutually exclusive as it seems. I believe that sacrificing chillness for grinding is worse than sacrificing grinding for chillness, because the chillness and fun motivates people to come to debates and grow anyway. 
- I don't think you should worry about being too chill and lenient, because being hardcore and strict tends to cause a worse effect in debaters ([but more on that later](#push-to-come-to-sessions)).

## Metrics
So if not tournament wins, what metric _do_ you judge the club by?
I personally say don't judge the club at all. 

- In theory, metrics are useful to judge a club to see whether the systemic change you implemented had any positive effect or not.
- However, unfortunately, Debsoc is not like a machine learning model where you can instantly see the result of one tweak. You usually can't even clearly pinpoint the cause of a change in the state of the soc that you see. A million different factors affect everything, and the only way to retrospectively decide whether a change was good or bad, is if you can somehow derive that the change directly caused certain impacts.
- Sure, you can ask people how they felt about a certain change, and take this feeling as a metric. The priority is the happiness of the members, more than any results.

_Common metrics people often take are tournament wins, number of active members, or number of active members in sessions, etc._
- Unfortunately, even the result from such a metric can be misleading. Just because you have less members this year doesn't mean you were shit at running the club. There are more factors out of your control than you can imagine.
- 'How skilled juniors are' shouldn't be the metric of whether you are a good mentor because everyone has different starting points. It's about whether they're getting better. It's about whether they feel happy in this club.

Sure, there aren't any provable 'harms' of using inaccurate metrics, except for the long-term culture of the club where juniors feel themselves being pushed towards results instead of enjoying the process.
(Like me being proud of studying more this month than last month, before having my spirits crushed by my father who informs me that my score has dipped. ~~He doesn't know that this chapter was way harder than the last chapter,~~ so I feel unfairly judged, because my knowledge and work ethic have actually grown). 

If you do _have_ to take metrics, try to somehow link them to the joy, growth, and interpersonal well-being of the members.

# Recruitments
[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Orientation

The main purposes of orientation are:
1. To paint a clear picture of what debating and the Debsoc are like.
2. To increase interest in debating.
3. To make people know what they're in for, so the people absolutely uninterested in parliamentary debating can drop out.

I think a great feature of our Orientation has been our Demo Debate. In the interest of time, we usually have a 2 vs 2. 
Letting the audience pick the motion among the 3 motions displayed on screen made the audience feel more involved. To use time efficiently, we continued the orientation during the prep time of the debaters. Efficiency is quite important because as the orientation stretches people lose focus and interest.

What I find very effective is to tell your own story, talk about how debating has improved your own life, and show the freshers what they can become.

In 2024, I engaged in crowd work while the club heads were setting things up for the orientation. Worried students commonly asked me, "Do you need prior debating experience to join the club?" This was probably since every other club filtered people based on skill.

I believe talking too much about the AP and BP format would just feel like an overload because there are so many complicated things to remember. This would give people more confusion than meaningful information.
 
## Recruitment Concepts

This is the single most essential activity of a club.

This is the single place (besides arguably PESDT) where systems matter the most, because 
1. You have an enormous scaled up load of both people and documentation to handle.
2. This first impression juniors have of the soc shapes whether they want to continue or not. A process that isn't smooth can be damaging to their perspective.

---
### History

First, a brief view on how recruitments were done in the past:
_My batch (2021, but recruitments ended up happening in the January of 2022) had one round of a quick 1v1 debate, which was online since this was the late Covidian era. The format was 3+1 minute speeches with one witness (like a silent round judge) and once the debate ended, we had no contact._
_The Debsoc took in everyone who participated in this round (except for my opponent who was missed out on due to a system error.)_
_For my first juniors, we had a similar format, just offline._ 

When it comes to recruitments, we naturally arrive at the big question of inclusivity.
How do you handle the trade-off between being inclusive/selective?

A few pros of being selective:

- A few PES clubs (like ECell) try to be extremely selective with their members. This generates initial hype over being a 'member of ECell.'
- Less members may mean less dilution of spirit and hence you can focus more.
- It's way easier to deny entry to someone than it is to kick them out later.
- You want to have people who actually care about debate so that you don't feel the emptiness of none among the 100 members of the group chat responding to your texts.
- People feel more comfortable to text their thoughts on the group chat when they actually know the people, rather than when they have never seen half the people.
- Small clubs may have more club loyalty than big clubs. In a big club you have random people who read group chats for entertainment and possibly pass on damaging rumors about seniors.

<br>
Since 2023, the Debsoc has followed Harsha's idea to increase selectivity while remaining inclusive, which was to check who retained interest at the end of a 3-round-recruitment process.

The first round remained the same. 
_The second round was a 'group discussion', with one moderator and 6 recruits. And the one who scored more 'points' would be the one who engaged more._
In 2024, we got rid of the group discussion round and replaced it with an AP lite round. I think the 2024 model is the best model we've had so far, and later I'll talk about why. 

The third round was a month long, with sessions every day, and people who attended the most sessions were recruited.

---
 **The month-long recruitment was highly effective** for a few reasons:

- Since it wasn't confined to a particular few days, people could come according to the flexibility of their schedule. 
- People could get a feel of debate before they committed.
- People filtered themselves out, so people who still attended by the end were the people who were genuinely interested.
- Glaring issues could pop up, making us aware of problematic people before taking them into the club.
- Recruits would form bonds and some amount of loyalty would be built up, reducing the chances of them backstabbing by leaking info from the group later.
- This was the best way to measure if someone could be an asset to the club in the future; to see if they would participate enthusiastically and be able to set aside time for the Debsoc.
- **In our messages to the recruits, we kept telling them that we were measuring their consistency. Unfortunately, some people interpreted this as 'consistently high performance' instead of 'high attendance.' One guy showed up for just one debate and later complained to me that he wasn't taken in 'even though he won 1/1 of his debates'. So being careful with phrasing is critical. Using the word 'attendance' instead is also risky since it could turn off people by reminding them of college.**

Having a round 1 and a round 2 before this month-long recruitment is still advantageous because
- People filter themselves out after round 1 and round 2, so you'll have less data to handle in round 3. 
- + Handling data consistently and accurately in recruitments is extremely challenging since the more names you have, the more time it takes to perform all the operations like searching, marking, and copying. The chance for names to slip by increases as well.

---
A few issues with the month-long recruitment:

- You need to reserve a block of a month for recruitments. In 2024 there were 3 weeks of the semester left in November, and hence round 3 got pushed to 2025.
- First year B.Tech and other branches have different exam schedules, and people will always be super anxious about not being able to come on the week of exams and the week before (oh the sweet summer first year children).
- + Another issue this leads to is that if all the active seniors belong to B. Tech, then there's nobody to conduct sessions when B. Tech has exams.
- People feel like a month is too much commitment for a club they might not get selected into anyway. (To solve this, you may have to try to reassure people that they are very likely to be taken in.)

![image](https://i.ibb.co/s95RnF86/Screenshot-2025-09-06-183012.png)
These two bar graphs are from people who dropped out early in round 3 yet still filled the feedback form (whose responses can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059).)

A month-long recruitment might bore some people. I don't fully trust the following positive responses to the feedback form, even if they were anonymous, but I'm glad some people still enjoyed the month-long recruitment.

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/Y7WSCDXf/Screenshot-2025-09-06-165550.png)

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/RkCMh2f4/Screenshot-2025-09-06-165811.png)

This level of selectivity captured the most benefits. I believe that being even more selective gives diminishing marginal benefits and leads to more harms.

Which takes us to **why I believe we should continue to push hard for inclusivity**:

When you see 240ish people on the recruitments group, you might get intimidated. Early on during recruitments, we had thought, "How are we going to run the club if all of them join?!"
However, the pattern I've seen across the years is that 20% of people don't even show up for round 1 and 50% of people don't show up for round 3. Regardless of how excited so many juniors seem, a lot of them definitely will still drop out.
Even among those who get recruited, 80% of people stop coming to sessions by the time second year begins.
A wider net translates to more people who stay.

### Depth wise inclusivity

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Reasons for being inclusive regardless of 'skill' are:

- The point of the club is not to just have good debaters, but to help everyone who is interested pursue this interest and _make_ them good debaters. 
- - Who the people are today is immaterial, they're just freshers. It's about who they can become. What matters is how the soc and the person will be able to contribute towards the growth of each other. 
- Skilled debaters aren't our only assets. Our assets are people who participate and contribute to the activity of the club. People who enable debates, who fill APs and BPs by just being there. Every person is precious. Without people there is no debate. Without people there is no soc.
- Debate is a weird activity where love can grow over time. Everyone who is lukewarm at first has the potential to grow love for it later. (I took 3 years to like debating.)
- - A good debater can always end up quitting. A bad debater can always have a growth arc. In the face of this uncertainty, the best metric available is their consistency, their dedication.


Hence, the benefit of having a tight filter isn't really clear. A loose filter works well enough.
**Accidentally leaving an interested person out is more expensive than accidentally taking an uninterested person in.**

Taking a few points out of Nikhil's recruitment document:
- "It would be unfair to judge candidates on their initial skill set without giving them a chance to improve.
- Even in the ‘worst case’ - if a participant still does not show any significant improvement debate-wise, if the person has put in the effort and work to show up for the sessions consistently, they deserve a place in the society for the following reasons:
- + Improvement is usually imminent. People improve at different rates; some people are slow learners (including myself), and some people struggle with other things outside their control. But the fact that these people are consistent is a good indicator of their work ethic and willingness to learn.
- + On a principle level, we cannot dissuade people from being members of the society except for equity reasons. The only absolute metric that a person can be judged by is their consistency and effort into the activity, and regardless of ability, these traits must be appreciated."

---
### ==Breadth wise inclusivity==

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

This has somehow become one of the most controversial practices of the society. **If you're against being too accommodating of people, please bear with me as I yap in support of it so that you're aware of the trade-off.**

By breadth wise inclusivity, I mean making an effort to take more people. Providing multiple days for people to finish their rounds 1 and 2. Adding extra days for the people who need them.  Making Round 3 open enough such that people with packed lives would be able to reach the minimum bar. 

Absolutely do not set a percentage of applicants as the bar like, "The top 90% will be recruited." This is dumb for the same reasons that percentiles in competitive exams are dumb: just because someone was in the bottom 10% doesn't mean that they can't or don't like to do math. It's better to measure marks in an exam (or whatever you use as an indication of interest like the number of sessions) and mark the threshold on that instead. Choose people for being interested, not for being more interested than others.


We usually conduct round 1 across 3 days so that people can come on any day according to their flexibility. Round 2 is also usually similarly over 3 days. 

**How are there always people who miss out?**

- When you scale probabilities up to 250ish recruits, 100 have a chance of being available 2 out of the 3 days, 120 have a chance of being available 1 out of 3 days, and there are usually 30 people unable to make it on any of these 3 particular days. Even if an incident is just 9% likely, in a sample of 100 people, this incident will likely affect 9 people. 

- This could be due to being sick, having some extracurricular class one day, having a high priority assignment another day, anything. Even if these seem unlikely, likelihood scales up with people. 

![enter image description here](https://i.imgflip.com/a72pv2.jpg)

- **Moreover, Recruitments are usually held in October November. Many students go home for a whole week during Diwali or Dussehra, or have a one-week PESU IO course, which can't be changed regardless of how interested they are in the Debsoc.**
- We do get swamped with requests from these people who were sick or out of town, and care enough to text us because they want to join the club.
- + You still can't measure such texting as the only indication of interest to join the club. There are people who would like to express interest but are unaware that they can text the clubheads and beg for this. 
- + If you do send out a message asking for all the absentees to dm you, then you can use this texting as indication of interest. This solves the aforementioned issue of people being unaware of their options.
A third option, initiating the text conversation yourself in the dms of everyone on the group who's left, asking if they want an extra day, is extreme and unnecessary. 

---
#### ==Addressing the criticism==
1. _Criticism of 'being too inclusive' usually goes along the lines of recruits becoming lazy and apathetic when they see a club 'desperately' going out of their way to pull in people. 'The prestige of a club is proportional to how selective it is, and the Debsoc needs to be prestigious.'_
2. _One thing I've heard is, "it definitely makes us look unstructured, unorganised, and bad planners which means people won't take debsoc seriously and feel they will get away with not coming for sessions and when we tell them they can't go to tourneys without sessions, automatically they'll leave the soc."_
3. _Scarcity leads to an increase in value, and conversely inclusivity decreases the value._

First, let's break the recruits into 2 groups of people:
Group 1: the people that you'd recruit by having a 3-day recruitment, a fairly strict round 1 and round 2, and also a medium-high bar to pass through round 3. 
Group 2: the extra people that you get by putting extra effort to be extra accommodating of people. 

_The assumption behind the criticism is that group 1 is filled with people who care, will continue to be hardworking, and will contribute a lot to the PES debsoc. And that group 2 has the lazy people who barely made it into the club._

The thing is, simply taking group 2 into the club isn't going to significantly impact the people of group 1, since group 1 already cares about debate. If I'm already a consistent debater and did my round 1 on time and round 2 on time, I don't feel harmed by the Debsoc letting more people in later. I don't lose interest in debate just because lazier people got in. People in group 1 do end up dropping out a year later, but it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause of this.

(I'm only impacted if there was a lack of transparency, like if I missed the birth of my first child to be at the session on day 3, and now suddenly the Debsoc tells me I could have come the next day as well, a sudden 'extra day'. This is solved by the group 2 people having to put extra effort like having to dm a club head or having to hope that they make it through the 'unofficial recruitments' (something which I'll discuss [later](#informal-recruitments). Group 1 people still get the benefit of peace of mind which they earned by being there on the right days.)

Group 2 is already assumed to not take the Debsoc seriously, so even if accommodating them makes them lazier and causes half of them to drop out soon, it's still a net positive because these are people you wouldn't have had otherwise.


People's interest in debate can fall or rise over time, based on what they discover about debate as time passes, and whether they like what they discover [(from the feedback form)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059).

This blue box touches upon a very complicated problem: the challenge seeming so massive that you give up on it, unaware that the real bar is lower. I don't know how to solve this without the contradictory messaging of "Guys come to as many sessions as possible," and "You just need to do 2 sessions in the whole month of round 3 to get into the club."

![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/ZYGmRW66/Interestovertime5-with-bonus.png)

A year later, you'll see lot of people in group 1 drop out due to **falling interest**. 
However, if you hadn't been extra accommodating, you'd never have gotten members from group 2 whose interest would have **risen over time** when debate turned out to be more fun than they had thought. 
Losing people who lose interest over time is fine, but we can't afford to lose people whose interest would have grown.

It's unfair to judge people's initial interest in an activity if some of them don't even know how exciting it can be. A few people who don't come to the initial days of round 3 (because they'd rather hang out with their friends after classes instead of debsoc strangers), come more often in the last 2 weeks when they've become more interested in it and find debsoc people to be fun to hang out with. (Sure, the last-minute worried grind effect does take place, but certain people have casually told me that they showed up more later on because it took time for them to really enjoy the soc.)


If it still looks speculative that you can find valuable people in group 2, I'll name drop a few major contributory debaters from it. Harsha didn't get in through round 1 and he pestered the clubheads to take him in. Sarah had lukewarm interest in debate for the first few weeks before she spammed sessions. Shreya was absent for most of round 3 due to health issues and can be seen having just one entry in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wqDueQaUqx8TkVNi5iS_a-iretiSL-CdvE7ugtJY5s/edit#gid=0). I didn't really like debating for my first 2 years in the debsoc. The bottom line is that it's easy to miss out on good people if you have a high attendance criterion for round 3.

---
Continuing the response to criticism: (point [2.](#addressing-the-criticism)) (people will feel they can get away with stuff)
- You won't look like bad planners since the reason for the extension is not you, but actually them, the recruits who didn't make it to the regular round 1. 
- Prestige doesn't have tangible value. The Debsoc doesn't need to be a prestigious club. It needs to be a good club which people have positive thoughts about. Being less inclusive because you care about prestige hampers your 3 main goals: growth, community, and enjoyment of the people, since you have less people to provide value to.
- It's way easier for people to bitch, "This club was so unfair and I couldn't get in," than it is for them to bitch, "This club was so easy and they took nearly everybody in." The image of the club won't be ruined if you aren't strict. It might actually be better.
- In feedback forms, people have been very appreciative of our inclusivity and flexibility which makes them feel cared for.
<br>
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/rGyg39VV/Inclusivity.png)

- Moreover, the idea of a tarnished image is a speculative harm, which weighs poorly against the real literal harm of people not being included even though they want to be. 

- Addressing the other half of the statement, it is very valid to have a high bar to get into a tourney instead, and keep a low bar of entry to the soc. 
- + Having a high bar to get into the soc makes debate itself completely inaccessible to the recruit, blocks away all mutual contribution that could have ensued from their entry, and doesn't even allow possible growth in interest or consistency later. 
- + Taking more people in is not a serious burden or harm for the soc.
- + However, with a tournament, reimbursed slots are limited because PES management applies pressure to reduce the number of people, and it's hard to push back against this. It's very valid to give reimbursement only to the people who have contributed the most to the soc; the people who have shown up the most for sessions. More on this in [Tournaments](#tournaments).
- + The argument of, "people will get accustomed to a low bar so they'll leave the soc if they see a sudden high bar for tournaments," isn't something really caused by the low bar of entry to the soc.

A major problem of the soc is the lack of members who actively debate 3 months after recruitments, but having more selective recruitments won't solve the problem. People don't get 'seriousness' by knowing that the club they entered had strict filtration. Any ego boost from having made it through the challenging recruitments, only has a very short-term effect in how much they show up for sessions. 
And nobody ever thinks this:
"If we had taken in lesser people, we would have had more active people today". 

![enter image description here](https://i.imgflip.com/a72qei.jpg)

I don't buy in to the logic of, "less people means less dilution which means more concentration of the activity", because people showing up, regardless of how passionate they are, made me feel warm about getting to have a full AP. 

---
Continuing the response to criticism (point [3.](#addressing-the-criticism)) (scarcity is proportional to value): 

This criticism has been applied on doing multiple matter sessions as well. 

- There are already 2 conflicting ideas. If you're doing it even for a few people on a particular day, it could also mean that the matter session is so valuable that you know these people can't afford to miss out on it, and that's why you're doing it for them. Different people might subscribe to different of these 2 beliefs, and so multiple options might even increase the value in their eyes. (Even for people who already have attended the session/recruitment, the debsoc showing that they care for its recruits increases their like for the club, as shown in the picture earlier).
- The initial poll of availability allows people to vote multiple options. Why would someone lie on a poll like this? If someone is available only on Friday (as explained earlier), then how would limiting the days to Tuesday and Wednesday convince this person to opt in? Missing out on this person is a real tangible harm, rather than the speculative harm of this being the tipping point to give them enough disinterest to not participate in the recruitment at all.
- There are 3 groups of people, people who really _do_ want to come to recruitments/a matter session, people who really _don't_ want to come to recruitments/a matter session, and people on the fence. Most people belong to groups 1 and 2. Even for people in group 3, to me it's quite far-fetched for me to think that increasing the matter session days from 2 days to 6 days will be THE major factor (the tipping point) which deters them from showing up to the matter session. 
- The issue with limiting days is that you're quite likely to lose someone from even group 1 (and others from group 2 for whom this extension thing is _not_ the tipping point). Regardless of them being interested in debsoc, there are often clashing events, clashing plans, and other stuff explained before which forcefully prevents them from accessing the value of the matter session.
- If there's a tradeoff to be made then sure, you can limit the options. If there's an actual harm of efficiency(delays), or preventing some other event, or consuming your time. There's just no trade-off of "interest in people/turnout", because there's more likelihood of losing interested people to this than gaining people on the fence.


---
So, how do you carry out breadth-wise inclusivity?

- I staunchly believe that inclusivity should be maximized if you have the bandwidth to accommodate these people.
- I took this to the extreme, and since I had free bandwidth in my 4th year, I would go to first year classrooms even 2 weeks after official round 1 recruitments to conduct unofficial recruitments for the people who had asked me. I don't recommend going the extra mile to this extreme without having the bandwidth yourself. Especially since during the recruitment period you'll already be attending more debates than a recruit.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgflip.com/a7995z.jpg)

- But if you have 4 people left to do their rounds even the next week, I advocate for trying to do their round 1 in your free time the next week.
- There are always people who are unaware of debsoc because our marketing didn't reach them, and want to join only after their friends who have completed round 1, tell them about it. 
- New people show up for round 2 all the time, and I believe that we should accommodate them by conducting their round 2 and then a round 1 for them later.
- I believe that everyone the debsoc can possibly reach, should be reached. But if you don't have the capacity to do so, then your capacity is a fine place to draw the line.
- One issue is that extending recruitments like this can cause transparency issues, when you try to pressure people to come saying, "Last day guys!", and still proceed to accommodate people who needed it after that. 
- + The way we sneakily side-stepped this last year was by saying, "Thursday is the last day for official recruitments", and then on Friday saying, "anyone who still wants to get recruited needs to dm one of the club heads".
- You can choose the stance on transparency that fits you the best.
- Ensure that this doesn't cause a delay in recruitments. Starting round 2 late because round 1 isn't over is dumb, the bulk of round 1s should be finished in a maximum of 3 days. The delay can be avoided if you conduct extra round 1s for the few odd people while round 2 goes on. Especially since round 1 doesn't take up much time, it's easy to fit in people while another group of people prep.

---
The drastic drop of people across recruitments and even beyond is unavoidable and happens every year. Don't beat yourself up over it, it's normal. 

![](https://i.ibb.co/2YNsSwzS/shooting-star-in-recruitments-inclusivity.jpg)

You will feel frustrated about all the time and effort you put for these people, but remember:
- **Even if people were temporary, they still contributed to the activity of the club for the time that they were there, and that's enough.**
- You did your part, you provided value to them, and your effort contributed towards the vision of the Debsoc.
- Every bit that you did, made you slightly better at debating, slightly better at organizing, and more knowledgeable of how people management works.

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/fVWxM8td/Screenshot-2025-09-06-165913.png)


Alright then, why have a recruitment in the first place? Why not just take everyone that wants to join the club, into the club?
Having an inclusive round 1, round 2, and round 3, while having a low bar for selectivity, still gives us like 80% of the benefits of selectivity that I talk about in [History](#history). And the best part is that when people stop showing up to debates during the month of round 3, that means they've lost interest and have filtered themselves out. And hence you don't need to add people to a group they don't want to be in.

## The 2024 model

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Round 1
Further developments from the 2023 model designed in 2024 by Nikhil:

I'll just quote from Nikhil's document from here until round 3. 

 - Round 1 now has 2 speeches of 4 minutes each from each person (like a half BP, no POIs).
 - 10 minute prep time.
 - + There is an increase in prep time from 5 minutes to 10 minutes. A lot of new debaters are intimidated by the process and struggle to kickstart idea generation, let alone structure and reasoning for the arguments. I personally was confused by the motion wording and felt a general sense of panic given the limited prep time during my round 1. An additional 5 minutes would help participants calm down, giving them enough leeway to structure their arguments and be ready to present them. 10 minutes is long enough to generate the level of arguments expected in round 1 but short enough to handle the scale of multiple people in a day.
 - After the speeches, the moderator asks questions to clarify logical gaps that the speakers may have missed in their speeches, giving them a chance to clarify themselves in a conversational manner.
 - The moderator later asks them retrospective questions on what they could have done better and how they would have argued for the other side.
 - + Previously, the moderator used to be passive in adjudicating the debate. Participants would leave after the speeches, and the moderator would note their inputs. In the new system, the moderator becomes more involved and 2 "enters the debate," interacting with the speakers and questioning them about various aspects of the debate. Here are a few reasons for this change:
 - + + Without 'active moderation', there is a feeling of mystery and anxiety after the speeches are over. The moderator passively tracks the debate, and participants are unsure about the metrics they are being judged on.
 - + + Most participants may have an intuitive understanding of the case, but it might not have come out in the speeches due to the new format and general anxiety of a recruitment round. The questions by the moderators are meant to allow speakers to explain themselves in a more conversational manner while allowing them to retrospectively analyze their case. The questions are aimed at understanding how well a participant responds to an issue in the debate that the moderator has pointed out.
 - + + From the participant's point of view, they feel that the process is more personal and feels like an interview of sorts. The questions assess them over multiple metrics, and they are also able to understand their performances better in retrospect.
 - + + In practice, this conversation is usually fun and leaves the freshers with the impression of, "Wow these seniors are so cool, nice and fun!" (as per what we've seen in the feedback form). This interaction is where freshers usually have fun, and this makes them want to keep coming back.
 - Example questions moderators could ask:
 - + "You mentioned point X and explained how that leads to impact Y. Could you provide more reasons how X leads to Y? Is X the only reason Y happens?"
 - + "Regarding point X brought out by the other speaker, you responded by saying Y. Do you think this effectively countered point X? How could you have responded better?"
 - + "What do you think was the most important impact you were trying to convey in your speech? Why do you think that is the most important issue in the debate?"
 - + "If there was a point you could have elaborated on more, what would that have been, and what new angles would you have added?"
 - + "Is there something you think the opposite speaker missed that you predicted they would say?"
 

I think these changes by Nikhil were absolutely amazing, they made the recruitment process so much more fun and engaging for both the moderators and recruits.
- Avoid letting the question session go on too long if you have a queue of participants waiting for their turn.

---
### Round 2

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Quoting Nikhil on the issues in the Group Discussion format of 2023:

- A lot of participants were introverted or had social anxiety, and though they had ideas to contribute to the discussion, a lack of confidence prevented them from doing so.
- The group discussion format quickly turns into a ‘loudest person gets the room’ kind of situation, where a person comfortable with pushing their ideas through and holding their stance through all the noise wins.
- The discussion takes the shape of the social dynamic holding the group in place, which dilutes the breadth and quality of discussion.

Why is this bad?
- Except maybe for panel deliberation, the skills tested in the group discussion round are never explicitly used in parliamentary debating. Sure, skills like quick thinking and being adaptive are transferable, but there are other methods to assess this.
- Participants might leave with the impression that cutting through the noise and voicing out their opinion is rewarded, and those who cannot do this will be dissuaded. This is bad because it goes against the fundamental aspects of debating, which are to carefully listen to other arguments and present yours without the fear of interruption.
- Many participants, including myself, felt left out of the conversation due to the social dynamics of the discussion. The moderator did try to include all participants manually, but this did not solve the fundamental problem with the method of testing.
- (From Srijan) A huge chunk of our loyal debaterbase comes from people who struggle with social anxiety who commit to the debsoc in hopes of getting better at public speaking. One bad (misleading) experience like this can be enough for them to give up hope.


Nikhil's round 2 in 2024 had the following features:
- It was a 3v3 AP lite with 4-minute speeches instead of 7.
- Participants prepped together while the speaker positions are kept a mystery by the judge.
- The PM and LO positions were announced at the end of prep time.
- After the first 2 speeches, both teams were given 5 minutes to discuss among themselves for the next 2 speeches.
- At the end of this time, the DPM and DLO were announced.
- After these 2 speeches, there were 5 minutes of discussion time before the Gov whip and Opp whip.
- There were still no POIs in this format.

Why was this new model better?
- It is important for participants to experience the team aspect of parliamentary debating before progressing to future rounds. Most debating involves collaborating with people to build and deconstruct arguments together, so it is essential to ensure that potential candidates are willing to work in a team. The group discussion format does not test this and rewards individualism.
- Group discussion portrays the wrong picture of what debsoc activities will be like. People who might like debating but dislike group discussion will be dissuaded from joining the soc. People who like group discussion but not the rest of debate will also be mismatched.
- Unknown Speaker Position: This incentivizes teammates to prep together and distribute the content they prepare equally across speakers. This prevents preparation from being focused on one speaker while others are just focused on responsive speeches. It emphasizes building the case and adds incentives for everyone to contribute and be ready since they could be the first speaker for their team.
- Mid-Debate Strategy Sessions: This helps teammates assess their performance in real time and plan their strategy accordingly. The first speaker gives inputs on what they couldn’t cover, and the team plans on rebuttals and the direction to take the debate in. The second speaker is not fixed yet, so the incentive process from the previous step continues.
- Focus on Teamwork: This process won’t be perfect - speakers may not fulfill their roles perfectly, and there might be analytical gaps in their speeches. This is alright. The point is to test how well speakers can work together as a team. And the participant also finds out how much they enjoy working in a team, and can better assess whether they want to join the soc.
- We also had a feedback form post round 2 for recruits to talk about the attitudes of their teammates, which helped us judge everyone, and helped us keep a note of signs of equity issues.

(end of quoting from Nikhil)

---

Round 1 and 2 are usually quite rushed because you're processing large batches of people.

Detailed comments about each speaker are nice, but they're too much work for an organizer who is going through around 12 people per day (during round 2). Personal feedback is more feasible in round 1 than round 2. 

In the interest of time and simplicity, it makes sense to drop a lot of procedures of debate. Explaining these rules takes quite sometime and can be overwhelming to someone new to debate who's already having a hard time remembering who the "Deputy Leader of Opposition" is supposed to be.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgflip.com/a77jc5.jpg)

We dropped POIs and proper OAs. A verdict is unnecessary and often misleading to recruits in round 2 because they expect it to decide their entry into the club (even after all the times we told them). We did give everyone a bit of feedback (which does feel a bit awkward without an OA or verdict), but it worked well enough to convince people that there was value (opportunity for growth) in the club.

Verdicts can be straight up demotivating, especially at a super early stage. It's more important to let people focus on speeches rather than the verdict. Quoting Nikhil, "People will get the false idea that the winner will proceed to the next round and will get the idea that debate is about winning and putting down the other side at any cost, so the incentive to act sus (cheat) is higher."

After round 1 and round 2, rather than saying, "You all have progressed to the next round", we released the list (of all names), and said that these people progressed. 
The massive issue here is that people who slip by due to administrative errors, believe that they actually got filtered out, and hence don't reach out to correct us (because they're unaware that we're letting everyone through). So you can try awkward stuff like "DM us if your name is not on the list", but it's complicated.

When I allowed POIs, even after stating the rules thrice, people messed up POI rules in increasingly chaotic creative ways, and they definitely are not worth the hassle in round 1 and round 2.

![enter image description here](https://i.imgflip.com/a734qr.jpg)

---
We also made everyone fill feedback forms where they talked about their moderator, their teammates, and their experience. This was very interesting to read, but often incomplete because a lot of people didn't remember names. Feedback is cool because recruits feel like they affect the way the soc is run, and also allows the Debsoc to change course if something has been quite a hindrance.

---
### Round 3

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

By the time round 3 starts, around 60% of the recruits will have dropped out, and the challenge of conducting sessions shifts from having the energy to handle one intensive day, to having the stamina to retain energy for a month.

Round 3 had full-fledged APs. APs are simpler than BPs so we have always started with APs for the last 4 years. If 8 people show up one day and all these people have quite some experience debating, then you can try out a BP, but in all other cases, I believe AP is the way.

Juniors are unaware that they even have the right to judge, so make sure you always give them the option to.

---

The weird thing about round 3 is how we've always dealt with the threshold. We've wanted to make the bar seem high (both to encourage debating during round 3 and post round 3) while actually keeping it low. 
I don't believe that making the bar seem high really encouraged debating post round 3, because the feeling of, "I've made it into such a prestigious club with a high bar for entry, so I need to make it count," seems like a very short-term push to me.

In 2023-2024, on the last night of round 3 before releasing results, we asked people with 5 or less debates to dm us if they really wanted to be in the club. We added these people to the recruitment list because they expressed interest. In reality we ended up setting the bar as 2 debates, and only made it look like the bar was 5. (So in the end even people who did 2 debates and didn't DM us got in.)

Since (for some reason) we cared about making the debsoc look prestigious and difficult to get in, we published a list of names showing who got accepted and who got rejected. We added a bunch of fake names in the rejection list, consisting of great debaters (relevant at the time) from around the country lmaooo.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wqDueQaUqx8TkVNi5iS_a-iretiSL-CdvE7ugtJY5s/edit#gid=0

In 2024-2025, when we were asked, "How many sessions are needed to get in the club?" we answered with the cryptic answer of, "There is no particular number. Something like twice a week would be ideal" (verbatim). Disclosing the exact number of sessions might dissuade people from debating more once they've hit the bar, which is why we spin this web of lies every year. It does suck to be non-transparent, but I consider it more important to get juniors to debate as much as possible to increase the likelihood of them getting hooked (and also increase their skill). 

The issue with this, as I've mentioned elsewhere, is that people might just give up hope since they can't reach the false threshold, and also might be anxious about making it in. The anxiety might hold less weight since it translates to relief once they've gotten in, but it mildly feels dishonest to scare people.

In 2024-2025, we held way more Round 3 sessions than the previous year, and after looking at the distribution of attendance, we decided to make 3 debates the bar. (3 plus the 2 debates of round 1 and round 2.)

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/352ZQvV5/Screenshot-2025-09-06-165446.png)
(A few of the Yes's and Maybe's came from people who had attended a bunch of debates.)

---

#### What wasn't implementable from the Round 3 model

You can never accurately predict how many people will show up to a session, who these people are, or which days they will show up, because people change their minds even after polls (and many don't vote).

Because of this, it wasn't possible for us to ensure that every junior got to pro-Am. It wasn't possible for us to make everyone judge at least once, especially when only 5 or 6 people showed up. It was too much of an administrative burden to track speaker positions, and then in the future check their past speaker positions before assigning them new positions (because the model had aimed to ensure that everyone had tried every speaker position by the end of round 3). 
The only thing that we could do was leave it to fate and 
hope that people naturally tried out different roles themselves.

### A few notes on recruitment debates

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

I talk more about initial sessions later in [Session Concepts](#session-concepts), but here are some extra tips that are more applicable during recruitment debates than the debates after they've joined.

---

A slight detour:
I once judged a debate tournament for schoolkids, and my chair was Yash Alva from RCL. The PM, who was a 9th grader, spoke for 4 minutes, and then her teammate kept whispering to her to help her in her speech. I was indignant that Yash wasn't doing anything, and thought he was a dumb chair. After the debate, he explained to me, "These are schoolkids. The PM was already nervous, and if I shut up her teammate she would feel more nervous and alone. I want to keep these schoolkids interested in debate, and scolding them would just traumatize them. The important thing is to keep them moving forward in debate." 
I was in awe. For a moment my eyes rolled back into my head, and I saw the far-sighted vision Yash possessed. I saw that it was worthy to bend the rules sometimes, to keep the people winning in the infinite game.

Some places I find worthy of bending the rules are:

1. Explaining the 3 motions. Teams are clueless about a lot of debate words. Giving them extra information helps alleviate how lost they feel. 
2. Keeping motion ranking even if it's a half BP. Motion ranking is quite useful because it gives people the illusion of agency. If a debate turns out difficult, they still 'chose' it themselves.
3. Doing like 3 minutes of case prep with each team if you feel like it, asking nuanced questions to stimulate their thoughts.

The rebuttal is that you shouldn't teach juniors the wrong rules of debate, and also that you're holding their hand too much. I believe that senior involvement is still great at making the Debsoc feel like a club, and that this matters more. 

---

Since we follow the AP format in round 3, 3 member teams can be unbalanced sometimes.
I found that checking up on team dynamics during case prep was pivotal to nipping unhealthy behaviors in the bud. Sometimes one person will be shy, and the other 2 people just talk to each other. Noticing this and reminding them to prep together can make a world of difference for this person. 

A very similar situation is when 2 friends come together for recruitments. Others have sometimes made an effort to split these friends into 2 different teams, maybe to prevent imbalance or to encourage socialization with new people, but I don't find this necessary. It can be more fun and less scary to debate alongside your friend. If you ensure that the third person doesn't get suppressed, I think things can still go smoothly.

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/MDLspPHv/Teamwork-Issues-add-this-later.png)

---

It's important to alleviate anxiety and make people associate the soc with good feelings. Make it very very clear that there's no real winner and loser, and that this isn't measured to get into the soc (since anyone would naturally assume that it is). 

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/Ld6K8wb5/Screenshot-2025-09-06-165112.png)


The sneaky thing about our recruitment model is that what people will be doing before the end of round 3, is the same as what they'll be doing once they're recruited, which is coming to sessions every week. What difference do they feel then? To make them feel like there's a difference, you can say that now they're in the club, they have access to tournaments, merchandise, and the 'super exciting' exclusive WhatsApp group.

This year 2025, round 3 got delayed for months (due to factors like IITB, tournaments, exam schedules, and processing round 1 & round 2 results. The end of recruitments slightly overlapped with NLSD, and we had to awkwardly maneuver and invite the people with the highest attendance before they were even officially recruited. 

---

A week before the end of round 3, I posted this feedback form (which I've linked on this document before). Most of the screenshots that you'll see across this document are from this form's responses.
[Feedback from recruits, halfway through the month of round 3](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059)
This feedback form does contain some sensitive information, but since it's anonymous, the average person shouldn't be able to recognize anyone. And hopefully by the time relevant people read this, the people involved will either be dead, will have forgotten details, or will be able to laugh it off.

## Recruitment Logistics

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)


This section is packed with lessons we've learned the hard way. A lot of these issues weren't predicted by us (due to overconfidence in our accuracy and memory), and I really don't want these mistakes to repeat (the way they've been repeating every year) since one mistake results in one recruit missed entirely.

Make sure everyone is on the same page with respect to recruitments. This may require a briefing text or an in-person/virtual briefing session. In late 2024 we had a few random people suddenly change the format at the last minute, and it led to a frustrating mismatch between the vision and implementation.

---

Round 1 has a massive load which needs to distribute evenly. 
Using a 'choose your slot' system can easily lead to chaos due to how fragile this system is. 
(I'm talking about having 6 slots everyday of 30 minutes each, and asking people to choose one of the 18 slots of the 3 days.)

If slots are tight and not adaptive to changes, people who expected to start their slot earlier will wait unnecessarily. (If you've had a Capstone review you know what I'm talking about.)
Recruitments are very chaotic due to factors like:
- Moderators coming at different times.
- Recruits coming at different times. (90% of your recruits won't come sharply at their slot time.)
- Debates going on for varying lengths of time.
- Sorting out a lot of aspects like guiding confused people to the basement, clarifying doubts, dividing people into batches, etc.
- Sometimes you'll have too many people for a debate, and sometimes you'll have too less. Having fixed people for fixed slots won't work because a lot of people won't show up.
- A lot of people would end up missing their slot entirely.

Being dynamic is the way to go. The super early people can go to moderator number one. The bulk of people who show up can be handled by the other moderators you have. As people continue to show up, hopefully the early moderators also get freed up in time to handle these people. 

To be able to handle people in the first place, planning is required.
And the way to do this is by first calculating the expected turnout.
Broader slots like, 'come anytime between 2pm and 4pm' are recommended over specific slots. This works fairly well to handle branches which are half an hour off, and people who dillydally for a while before reaching the basement.

With a WhatsApp poll, check to see how many people would come on the three days and the timings they are likely to come at. If one particular day has high demand and the other day has low demand (and if you don't have enough moderators on the high demand day), then you can ask people to shift from the high demand day to the low demand day if possible.
If people available on multiple days, a single response poll can't reflec this real ability. On the other hand, a multiple response poll might look overwhelming even if it's basically a duplicate entry.
So maybe you can first have a multiple response poll, and then a single response poll. This problem is too tricky to accurately tackle. Poll votes are inherently unreliable, but at least seeing expectations helps you to strategize and be prepared.

Even if it's a multiple response poll, it's too cumbersome to sit, compare days, and calculate which people voted for both Tuesday and Wednesday, and can hence be moved from Wednesday to Tuesday. Hence the only solution I can think of, is to send another poll later and ask people to vote Wednesday only if they can't do Tuesday.

If people miss a Tuesday or Wednesday slot, it's somewhat easy to move them to Thursday since the rush subsides by the latter days.

Sometimes a high demand day like Wednesday can also have a high supply of moderators, so sending a poll on the main Debsoc group to check moderator availability is crucial to the calculations.

### The Database

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

People are way less reliable than you think. EVERYONE. Even me. Even you. 

When everyone's running around in a flurry, and dealing with dozens of people a week, things get messed up all the time. I've seen this happen every single year of my 4 years in the debsoc. Errors are incredibly common, and it's incredibly challenging to build a resilient, fault-tolerant system with multiple checks.
The Debsoc constantly misses out on people due to system errors or forgetting to add people. We've met people months after recruitments who told us they weren't on the round 2 list and asked us why. We sobbed internally and asked them to apply again the next year. 
Ansh was a friend of mine even before Debsoc. When he and I texted, he found out that he wasn't on the list, and since I knew that he was supposed to pass, I rectified that. Nahush was missed out due to a system error. Only because Nahush texted Bharath in sem 2, was why Nahush was able to come to informal recruitments. Situations like this are unfortunately way more common than you may think. Errors scale with size. I don't know how many more times I'll repeat myself because I get very emotionally heated when talking about this stuff.


In 2022 and 2023, everyone input their data directly into an excel spreadsheet and it was GARBAGE. 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M2WkJ_aRrPAt8rKpz8pQXULVlVxOX8AjUCiqUCWwl28/edit?pli=1&gid=1313600469#gid=1313600469
This is how we did round 3 in 2023. 

It was a nightmare getting a hold of the link because it was buried somewhere on WhatsApp. There were a million other links pinned too. Someone had to sit and create a template page, and we had to copy the template page and create a new page for every new day of round 3. We had to be constantly reminded not to input directly into the template page because then it couldn't be duplicated. People still did input data into the page which the sheet opened with instead of scrolling to the appropriate page. If you go through the link, you'll see a bunch of missing names because the chair either forgot to write the names of who they judged or couldn't find the notes where they had written these names.
 
Absolutely never input directly into excel because it's very prone to mess ups. When you start inputting data after scrolling far right through the days (as seen in the below link), the person's name will no longer be visible. This increases the likelihood of inputting the data into someone else's record. Excel's ease of use is low to anyone new to it, because it has random keyboard shortcuts, and dragging a cell normally will copy its content to other cells.
We had to pore over the above spreadsheet to create a separate spreadsheet to mark attendance, and it was hell. This was the spreadsheet we released to the recruits for them to check if their attendance had been accurately marked:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wqDueQaUqx8TkVNi5iS_a-iretiSL-CdvE7ugtJY5s/edit#gid=0 

Below is the recruitment round 1 and 2 sheet. If you look closely, you can notice all the missing spots.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Dw2C0WZDU81iWJNsbwRixbpRiAfiQjuThH8jI7JFz64/edit#gid=538046766
You'll notice human errors here like duplicate entries for gov and opp, usually solvable in a google form with compulsory questions for the names of the speakers.
Multiple years, we had to fill a score for each speaker on the database. This was quite useless and a waste of brainpower because this was never considered as a factor to take recruits in (and I'm glad it wasn't). I think it's better to just do away with it entirely.

Sometimes when you notice something missing, you can track the missing data by asking the other people in the debate. This requires you to be quick enough and check the entered data every night. 


Regardless of how careful you are, data entry errors are incredibly common. At the very least, I think having a google form linked to spreadsheets is much more reliable than typing directly into the spreadsheet. 
Filling fields like, "PM's name, PM's phone number" of a google form is easier than having to click the right column and filling in the precise row of an excel sheet. Chair names and phone numbers are much less likely to be missing with this. 
When a Debsoc member acts as a swing, you just need to write (swing) in parentheses. This is better than leaving it blank because a blank name could cause confusion later about someone being missing.

There are 2 ways to implement this. One way is making moderators directly fill the google form. The other is having moderators write down the names and contact details somewhere and uploading these later. 
The drawback of the first one is that you may sometimes forget whether you've filled a person's details at all. Or something could change dynamically, like recruits getting swapped or leaving before the debate, but you can't adapt to this change since you may have already submitted the form. 
The drawback of the second method is that people tend to either end up forgetting to fill the form or end up searching where they've written names. Over the huge period of recruitments, moderators write details in multiple pages of random notebooks and it's hard to keep track of all of this stuff. 
I lean towards the first method.

It's quite common to get caught up in the debate once you've taken attendance at the start. Extra focus is needed to remember to take attendance every time a person comes in, so have a book open or something so that this helps remind you.

Test out your form, because last year we couldn't submit multiple responses until we fixed that a few minutes into recruitments. Decide whether you want responses to be editable or not (only the last response on google forms is editable).

A few moderators miss out on people's surnames either due to forgetfulness or due to believing that the surname for someone named something like Sudiksha wasn't required. Well, we ended up having 2 Sudikshas, and who knows which Sudhiksha stole the attendance of the other. 

If you have a name but not a phone number, and need the phone number for verification, searching the name up on the WhatsApp group won't always work. Even when it does, it might be misleading if you see a name like Sudhiksha and believe you've found your person. Some people save their WhatsApp names as ~ or * or .. instead of their real names. You might have to ask stuff to the whole group like like, "Who was the DPM in my room last Tuesday? Please give me your number," but you're lucky if they even remember who you are. 

I believe 2 candidate keys should be used. Full name, phone number, and SRN/email address. People can mishear phone numbers. People can misunderstand phone numbers written by the recruits themselves. Very often people show up to round 1 of recruitments without even being a part of the WhatsApp group, and searching for these people is hopeless if you've missed out on their contact information before. The safety of having these backup details is worth the effort.
In round 3, just the name and phone number can suffice because you're more in control of the world at that point.

Last year we had a system of code words, assigned by the chair, which were unique to each debate. This mildly improved trackability, because if people couldn't remember names, they could still be identified by the code word. When one has 5 people accounted for but not the 6th person involved in the debate, a code word can help. However, a lot of chairs (including me) forgot to give code words. If you can ensure the collection of phone numbers and another unique id, then code words are superfluous.


The most effective step to minimize errors, which should be obvious by now, is to upload the data to the central database ASAP. The longer moderators delay, the higher chance that they either forget to do it or forget where they've written the data, and the harder it is to track recruits by asking questions to other recruits.
Moderators needed to be given 3 reminders everyday, and each time I gave a reminder I could see people filling the form with fresh names they had written in their books (which made me wonder if a 4th reminder would lead to more people remembering to fill names).

One time, a friend of mine wrote names in a notebook but left the notebook in class. We panicked for 2 days over this until he found his notebook in another classmate's bag. 

I also messed up multiple times at the end of round 3 by adding the wrong people to Shenanigans before kicking them out. System errors are real. Even if the database administrator has the contact information of everyone, most moderators don't, and it can be quite a hassle to contact people and manage them.

### More Logistic Tips

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The basement seminar hall is difficult for first year students to find, especially since they expect it to be right under the ground floor seminar hall. Every year we have a dozen people calling us up or texting for help (even though the seminar hall was the room with the most activity). Clear instructions with pictures can go a long way. What we did was tell people to come to the basement and then we picked them up from there.

One thing that we overlook is the fact that other campuses named EC and HN exist xD. When you send a PESU notification, specify that this is for RR campus, to avoid an awkward conversation on the group later where you shoo people away.

This one time I was texting a debater who was one week into round 3, during an online session. He told me that the Debsoc was doing a great job and that we reminded him of his Oxford Union days. My eyebrows shot up and I asked him a few questions. I was alarmed to find out he had completed a post graduate degree and was currently employed at Ahmedabad. He just liked debate and was here.
Although this can't be avoided, and it _is_ important to make the link as accessible as possible, weird stuff like this _can_ happen. It's low impact and can be fixed easily, but it's still something to be prepared for lol.

Parallel processing using multiple moderators greatly improves efficiency, but it often isn't enough for round 1 and round 2. 
An extra technique which was very beneficial in 2024 was pipelining.

When all the moderators have their hands full, at least one person still needs to keep an eye out for people streaming in. When all of us had ongoing debates, I would give a set of 6 people their motion and start their case prep to minimize their idle time. Around the time they got done with prep, one moderator would get freed up and ready to judge. Reducing inconvenience greatly enhances the quality of experience of a recruit. If a recruit ends up waiting for more than 15 minutes, then the system is flawed. 
If someone has been waiting with 2 other people for 15 minutes, then you might as well get them started without waiting for more people.

Starting case prep early like this is useful even when you expect a moderator to show up in 10 minutes, because their arrival will coincide with the end of the case prep of the recruits.

### The Digital Attendance Tracker

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The core concept of DAA (Design and Analysis of Algorithms), which people who have taken the course may have learned, is that when the amount of data involved increases, manual brute force methods become cumbersome (and also have a higher chance of error), and a smooth automated system would work better.

I think this website discovered in late 2024 is ABSOLUTE GOLD, and it made the round 3 recruitment tracking process much smoother than it had been in the previous 3 years I had seen.

https://myattendancetracker.com

I won't type much about the pros and cons of this system because they're all included in the private (to be specific, unlisted) YouTube video I made of how to use the website:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2L9hfdCo3ds

If you want to check out the exact way we used it last year, log in with these credentials, scroll to March 2025, and then select any of the 3 classes: 2:30 pm, 4 pm, or 9 pm. But honestly the Youtube video is enough and you don't need to do this.
spamsrboy@gmail.com
password: debsocfuture

I recommend using a new account because otherwise the names of your new recruits will be buried among our old recruits.

It might look complex initially, but I swear by everything I hold dear that it's absolutely worth it because I've seen how recruitments turned out without it.

The code used in the video and the data (which is unnecessary since your data will be different) can be accessed here:
https://github.com/SrijanBadhya/Debsoc/tree/ed0d5f52bb7d4581572d96c8d29d436463303617

If github is too complicated, you can download the files from the google drive folder here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1df_Uj1Gv3KbeVLcosL4qO-7g97mXSBZN?usp=drive_link


Tracking attendance digitally saves time and effort at the end of recruitments, and actually minimizes errors throughout the process (including compilation errors at the end). The highest chances for error are the parts which are dependent on humans, like collecting data from everyone, inputting it, not mixing up 'Jhanvi' with 'Jahnavi', and communicating responsibilities with each other. 
Last year I handled the website alone so everything went smoothly for me, I just had to ask every chair for a session report after their session. If you split the responsibility this time, there are possible data synchronization issues (like forgetting to upload names if you're used to someone else uploading them). 

If you can find a way (like a better website) to access the benefits and overcome the flaws, then that would be great.

## Meme day

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

My favorite tradition to continue on the last day of every recruitment season is meme day.

Announcing that it was meme day led to a surge in attendance for this debate in 2024. 

The specialties of meme day are that the motion is funny, you are encouraged to be as funny as you can, you get unlimited speech time to yap all your ideas, there's no protected time, and there's no verdict or OA.

Sam and I hunted for meme motions but a bunch of meme motions such as, "This house prefers pineapple on pizza" were pretty empty
The motion I used both years was, "This House, as a first year at PES, Would choose to NOT join the Debsoc."

For a motion like this, to emphasize that this motion is being debated for the fun of it, it makes sense to have no verdict or OA. 

The motion weirdly has the phrase, "Would NOT", which is weird for gov, but this is necessary to ensure that the debate starts off with a bang.

I heavily encouraged shitting on me personally, saying that it wouldn't affect their chances of getting in, and this led to the debates being incredibly entertaining and super fun for everyone involved (to the point where we were rolling on the floor laughing.) This motion feels incredibly fitting for the last day of recruitments.

Video recording is optional. It makes for great lore but decreases the chances of juniors being unhinged.

It feels incredibly fulfilling because the extent to which the juniors shit on you shows how comfortable they've gotten with you.

An alternate motion which does make more sense is, "THR participating in the Debsoc recruitment process." This however nudges people more towards likelihood analysis on getting in which could be boring, as opposed to the other motion which nudges people towards saying the club is a shit club to join.

While fun, these motions double as a raw insight into the lives of first years and their feelings about the debsoc (even if their speeches are exaggerated). Gov breaks you down and Opp builds you back up. It's truly a wonderful experience.

# Inside a session
[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Session Concepts
Many factors go into ensuring the quality of experience of a debate session.

Debate is an extreme sport, and half the people are inevitably going to feel sad at the end of a session.

![The Judge Every Session](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/535/089/5e9.jpg)
(The Judge every debate)

 Sadness cannot be avoided, but we can absolutely work to minimize its sting.
 
Debate is weird and often an acquired taste. I believe that it takes quite a while to get a feel for debate before you fall in love with the real thing, rather than what you thought it would be. So, hooking in people to come for the initial sessions in the short term, is crucial to push them towards the love point. (This love point is usually the point where your brain gains 'debate vision', and you start to understand what goes on in a debate.)
For this purpose, I think it's justified to paint an incomplete picture of debate and slowly nurture people before you hit them with the brutality of it.

What I mean by this is:
- Not dropping finance and IR (International Relations) motions in the early days.
- Even within other subjects, giving easy and accessible motions (and motions they would find fun). Feeling hopeless and having nothing to say before a speech is quite depressing. 
- Although we know that nearly all motions are balanced, freshers often think most motions are unbalanced. It is possible though, to find easy motions which even they will find balanced.
- Philosophy motions are usually fun, but unfortunately usually follow the format of, "THW use this amazing technology", and feel unbalanced for opp because:
- + Freshers feel lost thinking of an opp case since the benefits look great and they don't know how to outweigh them.
- + Beginners don't often think about regulation, mismanagement, and long-term consequences.
- + So even if there is tremendous learning potential after the round, people can feel depressed during the round itself.
- + (If you can give hints of the case lines, like regulation, to both sides, then you can still make it work. This however involves bending the rules of debate, but I found it to be worth it.)
- Not being brutally honest in the early days and telling speakers their speeches were shit.
- Spending extra time and effort in the early days compared to later days, providing aftercare to the wounded recruits.
- Being generous with prep time so that they build their confidence and lessen their anxiety. We don't need to make them tournament-ready until later.
- I found it helpful to **have a short speech before every debate saying that verdict doesn't matter, growth happens regardless, and what matters is that they enjoy it.** Because even if this is common knowledge, I believe this needs to be drilled into the heads of freshers so that they are in the right headspace every debate. I did this throughout round 3, but I think post round 3 it probably isn't really required because they're used to it.

If you're reading this, you must have already faced the grueling learning curve of being humbled over and over. I believe that if people are exposed to the extremely challenging parts of the learning curve too early, they wouldn't have the love-fueled commitment to persevere through the hardship.
- I know this may look like treating juniors like snowflakes. Even so, debating does get sad, some friends and I still get sad on the regular. Having someone show empathy to you can mean the world to you.
- + _Sure, the argument against this is that if you keep protecting them, they'll never be able to stand on their own two feet._
- But I disagree, regardless of how much their wounds are bandaged by you, recurring wounds make them stronger naturally with time.
- + _The other argument is to just follow natural selection to quickly end up with the debaters who had the most mettle to begin with. But I believe people can grow mettle over time (with your nurturing), and you're leaving these people out if you just let them end themselves._
- + From personal experience, I and a few other people would have quit debating early if we felt like we were inherently too dumb for this shit. So try to effectively balance humbling, learning, and happiness, to keep them coming until they're ready to face hard mode. 


![enter image description here](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/944/435/931.jpg)

- Keeping it challenging yet making people feel like they were able to contribute something significant is key.
- The first part is not hard, since even the easiest motions are challenging to recruits (due to various reasons like not reaching 7 minutes). This translates to already a high amount of learning already. Any benefit by doubling difficulty is marginal.

![image](https://i.ibb.co/tPCYNSgR/sadaboutdebate1.png)
![image](https://i.ibb.co/dw3rpnpr/sadaboutdebate2.png)
- I've come to believe that **love for debate can't really be tested from day one.**

## Time
[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

From the feedback forms and personal experience, the single biggest deterrent of attending debate sessions is time. 

![idle time](https://i.ibb.co/F47qvtxK/idle-time.png)

Having to **sit idle** before a debate starts significantly diminishes a junior's experience of the session. The delay stretches in their head and this contributes to the belief of debate being a waste of time. 
Multiple delays in each process add up and lead to juniors starting late and going home even later.
- Often in 2023, juniors would show up to sessions before seniors and then ask on Whatsapp, "Any senior here?" It was extremely optically bad for seniors to look 'unserious' and uncaring of juniors and debate.
- Even if they had consented when asked, "Are you okay waiting a bit for 5 people?", making 1 person wait for 5 more people to show up before starting AP prep is a massive delay for the first person.
- In 2023, after juniors had shown up, the seniors would still take quite some time to choose a suitable motion for juniors. A lot of time was taken to filter a motion because they also needed to give juniors motions which they could understand (which is still a good habit by the way). 

![enter image description here](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/003/105/514/a81.jpg)

The obvious solutions to this are:
1. To do whatever it takes to show up as early as possible or have someone else there to get things going.
2. To engage in conversation with the first person. It can be about what brought them to the debsoc, what interests they have (and you can even make a motion related to their interests and get them speaking on it until others arrive).
3. **To start prep time even when you have only 2 or 3 people, even if you expect more people to come. This is okay because:**
 + You can't always rely on the people who voted to arrive, and this could result in waiting unnecessarily for nobody. (I learned this the hard way.)
+ Having extra prep time isn't much of a harm. At least people don't feel like they're sitting idle since they're doing all they can to come up with a case.
+ You can inform the juniors that they will be ironing, and if others show up later, you can replace the iron slots.
 + People who come early deserve to get the extra prep time. Maybe this will incentivize latecomers to also put extra effort.
 
 ![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/vxmXxr6y/Screenshot-2025-09-06-164214.png)
 (I know the responses say that the current system is perfect, but I think there's no big harm to start even earlier and hence cut the idle time of the 3 people who have already shown up). 
 
 + Prep time isn't as valuable to whips anyway, since their content majorly depends on what is said during the debate. People who come just before the debate is supposed to start, can be whips if slots are open.
 + You can choose to either shorten the total prep time, or have the initial prep time as a bonus, depending on how late it's already gotten.
 + Making latecomers adj can be problematic to how adjing is treated and the narrative that this propagates. [Be careful about the narrative you build around adjudication](#the-adj-narrative).
4. Something I'm guilty of myself is taking too much time to prepare my OA.

<br>
5. **Have a list of motions made in your free time before the session, so that you're not wasting session time.**
Here are the motions I used in 2024-2025.
[Motion list](#motion-list)
 They were curated to fit the motion criteria talked about earlier this chapter. I have cut out around 30 motions I had initially thought were good, yet ended up leading to messy debates, showing they were bad motions.
So all the motions left here are ones whose debates ended up being decent enough to pass my test.
Feel free to reuse these motions or compile new ones.
I had prioritized parenting, education, and romance motions, but the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059) shows that people soon got bored of these motions and wanted different ones too.
<br>
![From the Google Form](https://i.ibb.co/fd1q7Tyk/motionpref.png)
- There are also oddballs who want finance and IR motions, and these people usually get sidelined in the interest of keeping the motions debatable for everyone.
You can consider occasionally catering to these people (I should have).

Since debates usually involve 6-8 freshers and 1 senior, what naturally happens is that the senior methodically conducts the debate, then the debate ends and people go home. This is the default state that seniors have too.
- Debate feels like a college class where you're one random person lost among the masses.
- If I had to pick the one principle I found the most important to keep in mind, it would be to **give individual attention to every participant**. 
- Not everyone approaches you themselves to ask for personal feedback, so you need to find a way to have one on one interactions with everyone.
- Make people feel valued, make people feel that they made a difference by being there. Because very often people do feel left out and feel like they don't belong.
- Everyone belongs, so make sure they do feel that they belong.
- The one-on-one interaction can be about anything. It doesn't have to be feedback on their speech, just whatever they feel about everything.
- Having ties to the community is what really fosters loyalty and makes people excited to come to the Debsoc.

---
You will be quite busy as an organizer and a judge, and when OA preparation time consumes you, it's hard to give people individual attention.
**At that moment, it can be crucial to tell at least people, to cross over, shake hands, and chill.** 
- It's detrimental if people are sitting in their own seats scrolling their phones during your OA prep time. 
- After people cross over, conversation on the debate usually gets going. There are unresponded POIs and other thoughts on the debate that people are often bursting to say, but too hesitant to break the silence.
- This initial conversation gets the community vibe started, and freshers usually carry the conversation themselves after that.

##  Feedback

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Unsolicited advice is annoying to anyone. You can either choose the consent approach of meeting each speaker and saying, "Do you want feedback", or you can say, "Anyone who wants feedback can ask me now". I prefer the latter approach because it sort of puts social pressure on them to _ask_ for feedback lmao. And when people ask for advice, they're likely to value it more.


Feedback is often tricky once your brain has shut down after the debate. I remember when I sometimes just tried to make up something from my own notes or defaulted to something generic.

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/PG48xPjT/feedback.jpg)

One thing I found handy was to write down my feedback as the speeches were happening. The moment a question came to my mind during the speech like, "Why are people going to behave the way you say," I wrote it down in brackets next to their statement. It also helped me deliver the feedback quicker when asked for it.

Ideally the judges who conduct sessions, are ones who've read and understood the manual, since 
- Their feedback is far more likely to be valid.
- Reading the manual also gives the judge conviction behind their feedback because they know it to be correct, rather than saying, "I'm not sure about this but I don't think you're allowed to edit your model in the second speech, I'm still not sure though".
- Wrong feedback can set debaters back quite a bit and it's hard for them to ever realize that this is wrong later. They are likely to approach future debates believing this is right, and also ignore tourney adjes who contradict this feedback because "these tourney adjes don't know what they're talking about, I trust my senior more".

The impulsive way to give feedback is telling people how they messed up and what they can improve on.
But I think **consciously trying to tell people what they got right** as well is incredibly impactful for a few reasons:

- Freshers come with various styles and experiment a lot. They sometimes demonstrate untaught genius, like surprise weighing. It's a positive reinforcement loop if you give them a signal that this is something good which they should keep doing. 
- If juniors just change their approach constantly, they won't really know what to keep.
- Just like tournaments, speakers feel understood and cared for when their ideas were received by the judge. The more positive emotions people associate with the debsoc, the more they'll want to keep coming.
- From the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059), something juniors feel is, "I'm working hard every day but get the same brutal feedback all the time, am I just unable to grow at all? Is there any point to this?"
<br>
![image](https://i.ibb.co/27VvCzRf/feedback-reaction.png)

- They're already getting humbled by other factors. We don't want them to get humbled to the point where they quit.
- "You got so far doing this right, you just need to tweak the last bit of delivery," is quite motivational for someone to hear. This balances happiness and motivation to grow.

(I personally didn't follow this as well as I should have. Only a small portion of the time did I consciously give positive advice. I should have done it more, I was just too deep in the zone of 'constructive criticism'.)

A great way to give feedback to debaters, is to **ask them questions about their case** like, "Why do you think this is true?" and once they answer, say, "This is good reasoning which should have come out in your speech."
This solves a few problems:
1. If you give regular feedback, it might feel wrong to them (like they disagree with you, but they won't push you more on it).
2. Your feedback could have felt obvious to them otherwise, especially if it was something like, "Your speech was chaotic, I need you to be clearer."
3. More importantly, it makes them feel good about themselves since it came out of their own mouth. This makes them realize it isn't an inherent IQ issue but actually a presentation issue.

---
Once you tell debaters that speaker scores are a thing, they'll sometimes badger you to give them their scores. I, for one,  believed speaker scores shouldn't be given in mock for a few reasons:

- Speaker scores are such a scam. Different judges give different scores, the brackets are unclear, and well-structured speeches also receive low scores sometimes. The manual also feels like it's up to interpretation. Judges may not know how relevant 'frequently relevant' really is.
- At least with feedback, you can give everyone feedback and criticize them all. With public speaker scores, there's an 'objective' hierarchy of who is the worst debater in the room, the second worst etc., (at least in the eyes of an average fresher).
- There's no real benefit of 'extra motivation to grind' when you give people speaker scores.
- When they've already had a bad day, shitty speaks can further mess them up. 
- The argument against this is, "Omg they won't know how speaker scores work in real tournaments then," but to me, the harms outweigh the benefits. It's not really important to know how speakers scores work at tournaments unless you're a judge.
- Another argument is that people can track their progress. This doesn't quite materialize often. Speaker scores are quite stagnant since the realistic range is so small. Seeing yourself constantly oscillate between 73 and 77 can give you the illusion of a lack of progress.

## Balancing

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Once you know the skill levels of people, you can occasionally match up teammates to make the debate 'balanced'.
- Losing debates nonstop will get to anyone. Even the 'weakest' debater is a valuable member of the soc, and their self-esteem needs to be maintained to keep them motivated to come to sessions. Even if they feel like trash, they shouldn't further feel like utter trash. (In fact a weak debater is a vulnerable stakeholder, and if the Debsoc isn't able to uplift those who work hard, then it's a skill issue of the Debsoc.)
- I found that stealthily teaming them up with debaters I found smart, kept the debates close and exciting too.
- This also gave all debaters experience in working with different kinds of people.

---
## Keeping it fun

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Debate can get boring fast until you've stayed long enough to acquire the taste. 
Don't be afraid to sprinkle in stuff like Harry Potter motions, PES related motions (carefully), the sugar daddy motion (Motion 39 over [here](#motion-list)).
- This leads to more fun, laughter, and people finding the soc to be a place they can have a great time in.
- Being informal and saying weird stuff makes people get more open and comfortable with each other.

There isn't much 'risk'.
- People won't care enough to straight up complain to the PES management about this.
- It can't possibly be sensational enough for a mass forward unless there's a video recording or something, and that's easily preventable.
- The worst that could happen is people joking about it with their friends from out of debsoc, and that's just free marketing.
- Through the debates so far, people already know that the debsoc usually debates serious topics, so this won't make the entire soc look unserious.
- Even if the motion ends up in the hands of PES management, they wouldn't care enough to give us serious consequences. Our usual feminism motions about sex positivity and regretting the stigmatization of hookup culture are riskier, but we're desensitized to them.

#### Turncoat
When there have been 2 or 3 people showing up for a session (like it often happens in the odd sems before recruitments), we played Turncoat with each other. The speaker is given a prompt, and every time the prompter claps their hands, the speaker has to switch sides. Sometimes we have fun prompts too like someone's feelings about their microbiology professor and Bharath's experience conducting PESDT.
It is still well aligned in the direction of sharpening your debate skills, and is super fun because of how quick-witted you have to be while changing your flow.

We used this to market the Debsoc during the club showcase at Aarohi too, back in 2024. We wrote the topics on chits and placed them in a bowl for freshers to pick and speak from.

---
#### Alley Debating
I spoke to a few debate prodigies from Aditi Mallya (the two girls who were runners up at PESDT in 2024), and they told me about Alley debating. We've implemented it twice in debsoc sessions.
The way it works is that everyone goes to the podium and stands in 2 lines of 3 people each. It works like an AP with no prep time, no POIs, and 1-minute speeches per person. We would pass the phone which held the timer like a baton from speaker to speaker. Every speech had to be some sort of an extension like BP.
It was fun cause of how goofy it was, and very time efficient too.

---
#### Impromptu debates
Pretty straightforward. Especially good when there are like 2 people for a session. No prep time, the motion drops and the PM just starts yapping. (The LO technically gets 7 minutes prep time.) For more participants, this format isn't as impactful because they don't feel the time crunch as much (It feels like a regular debate).
It's a good way to keep you on your feet and make you better prepared for tourney time crunches.

---
#### Pop debates
The way the Debsoc conducted recruitments for my batch in Jan 2022 was by enticing us with pop culture referencing motions. With AI, this has gotten even better to do because you can ask it to give you, "Naruto debate motions", and it actually cooks fun motions. 
The drawback of this is that not all of the debaters would have watched Naruto, so these people don't share in the fun. 

Such fun motion days are best for when chatter in the Debsoc has progressed to the point where people know each other's likes and dislikes, and only a few people with common interests have shown up to the debate session. I did a 1v1 on a Maroon 5 motion versus Raj, and Raunak did a 1v1 on a How I Met Your Mother motion versus someone. ChatGPT is actually pretty good at generating motions for a niche interest which doesn't have readily available motions (that's what we did for Maroon 5).

This variety of debate activities keeps debate fresh and fun.

---
#### Game Night
Online Game Nights existed during quarantine, and were revived by my batch of clubheads in 2024. Popular games are the ones people have experience playing in class already, like Skribbl.io. 

If you've successfully gotten everyone onto the PES discord (which is a feat of its own), then discord has a lot of inbuilt games in the 'activity' feature, like PuttParty, which we once played. It also makes it easier to get on Voice Chat alongside this, which adds to the fun.

### Online Sessions

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

At the beginning of his clubhead term, Nikhil and I walked around during breaks and asked random 2nd years how they felt about clubs. A surprising number of them said that the factor keeping them away from clubs was accessibility, because they had to travel home and couldn't stay at PES. They wished there were more online activities from clubs.

While Nikhil and I understood this exclusive benefit, we're still certified haters of online sessions.
- The community aspect doesn't feel natural because someone has to initiate conversation during OA prep time (and the responsible senior is usually busy prepping their OA). This cannot be just a, 'cross over shake hands' initiation, but an actual mention of some topic. You have to ask someone a particular question. 
- Without being able to see each other, conversation quickly turns awkward.
- Due to a lot of issues involving talking over each other, it's impossible to have 6 people talking at once (which is possible offline). When people do talk over each other, they pause, repeat themselves, and things feel awkward.
- It's easy to become depressed post your debate because you're all alone (happens to me often).
- Conversation between the seniors and juniors often ends after the OA/feedback. You have to consciously initiate further conversation. However offline, conversation would happen naturally on the way to the gate.
- Nobody really leaves an impression, you can't often remember debating alongside someone if they were just a name on your screen.
- People either forget about the session, or join really late because there are so many things at home that can take up your time. Back in 2022, online sessions set for 9 pm used to start at 10 pm. 
- If someone starts off debating with online sessions, they might drop out because they're unaware that online sessions are far inferior to the fun of offline sessions.

However, since you can access a few people who are online-only, I'd recommend doing at least one online session a week for these people who don't wish to come offline. Preferably a Friday evening or Saturday evening. The Debsoc gravitates to the 9 pm time. Even when we tried to schedule these sessions earlier, we were shown that a majority of college students are available only at the 9, 9:30 pm time.
Even if they don't practice body language and the feeling of speaking to a physical audience which are useful for tournaments, they still get tournament-ready for online tournaments.

The closest I've ever been to quitting debate, was after an online debate. I gave a shit speech, left the call entirely, flopped onto my bed, and stared at the ceiling. 
It means the world to people if you dm them and check up on them and how they feel about the session (even if you weren't involved in the session).

### Cross Mocks

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Everyone goes on about how game-changing cross mocks are, and how they give you the tournament experience without needing to pay for it. 
Here are some of my thoughts about the challenges, pros and cons of them.
1. The groups Mixidea and 4crossmock are more bloated than ever, and the dead outnumber the living. It's no longer like our days where access was easy either. Sure, other groups always pop up, but their activity isn't as consistent.
2. Most cross mocks get cancelled due to the adj scarcity. Even if you do find an adj, they're unlikely to be of high quality and give you the 'mind-blowing diverse genius new perspective' feedback which you're looking for (because only new judges are the ones willing to judge a random cross mock). (Both a lack of capacity since this is a noob judge, and a lack of incentive since you're not a part of their soc.)
3. The whole argument of cross mocks is that regular mocks lead to inbreeding, where everyone's just following the same debate gene pool. Everyone is isolated and could be veering off what real debate is, and there's no one to correct them.
I think this is slightly exaggerated, because:
- As long as people have access to the WUDC BP manual, you'll be mostly accurate enough. 
- Even if you debate the same people over and over, it's rare for this to be the cause of improvement plateauing. There's so much you can improve even with the same people, like how well you characterize, mechanize, analyze, impact. Other people's debating _styles_ have less impact on your own skill improvement imo.
- Before you reach anything close to a plateau of debating the same people, new juniors will have appeared.
- Even if you're clueless and just debate over and over, there are still things to be learned, public speaking to be improved, and fun to be had, which meets the 3 goals of the club.
4. Tournaments _do_ provide a lot of the benefits which cross mocks try to provide but fail to.
5. To be fair, speakers in cross mocks are usually more skilled than debaters at PES, so judging a high-quality cross mock or speaking in one (if you miraculously find an adj) can be beneficial to see how experts do it. 
- This can still be gained by watching WUDC videos online, but to be fair there's more procrastination to watch a WUDC video than a "spar at 9pm today". (Side note, a great way to learn debate is by doing speeches and then seeing what the people in the round spoke. These directly give you access to great speakers instead of being limited to the weak speakers at PES LOL. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YhK_1sxcSrt2CZhD_U4Y4FLEPGus7yu2td7NFLd5ze4/edit?tab=t.0) is a document with a bunch of recorded rounds of Majors.)

University-specific cross mocks are great at improving inter soc ties. A lot of societies do have the interest to do cross mocks with PES yet often lack the capacity.
I was the head of the NLS x PES cross mock initiative, and I saw that lot of issues of sessions were exacerbated in cross mocks.

1. If you thought syncing schedules between B. Tech students and non B.Tech students was challenging, try syncing with A WHOLE OTHER UNIVERSITY.
2. If you thought getting people to come to sessions was challenging, try getting people WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU to vote and come.
3. If you thought the walk to the basement deters people, think about travel to a whole other campus.
4. Of course, cycling the adjes and taking turns is another challenge.

Sure, online sessions mitigate these issues to quite some extent, but they pretty much convert the university-specific cross mock into a regular cross mock.

With NLS, I've held one online cross mock, 2 offline cross mocks at NLS, and one offline cross mock at PES (I adjed them all).

The first offline mock had a few interested NLS students and a few PES students. NLS people spend all day in the library, so to get enough debaters, my NLS friends had to beg their debsoc friends and drag them from the study zone of the library to the zone where we were debating.
Clearly such people couldn't be dragged all the way to PES if a mock happened there.

The second offline mock at NLS was when three friends called me since they wanted to practice for a tournament, and I brought two people from PES along.
These offline sessions had fun vibes because we did get the tourney excitement of being at a new campus and facing new people.

For the offline session at PES, an NLS friend of mine dragged her friend to PES and we did a half BP. I was disappointed with the PES turnout because I had thought the debate being local would drive more people.

The other 4-5 times I tried to hold sessions with NLS, I got a lackluster response on the polls.

---
In summary, I think cross mocks are cool when they're successful. Making them successful is quite tedious. I don't think it's really a cause for concern if you're doing too few cross mocks, because there are plenty of other ways to access their benefits. And even if you inbreed, it can't be _that_ bad. (Okay I'll stop using that word.)

----
## A few issues of sessions that persist

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

a) Dividing the workload:

Every year we try hard to encourage people to come, and people do 'commit' in theory. 
But it always looks like people lack the push to actually show up.
We've had seniors take up voluntary adjing slots using an excel sheet before, but people would often either forget or not feel obligated enough to write their name themselves.

I don't know if this is due to the bystander effect caused by there always being someone already conducting the session. 
Even if there already is someone, **more seniors are always needed.**
- The person who 'conducts' the session usually ends up judging, which can tire them out. Taking over their judging shifts and letting them speak gives them a chance to refresh.
- My conversation with Akshat Saxena taught me that pro-ams are one of the most crucial ways to fast-track debate progress. Pro-ams help juniors understand what the right debate habits are. 
- Case prep with a senior you've teamed up with by itself is an incredible learning experience, and a very cool fascinating experience for the juniors that I've spoken to.
<br>
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/CsvVJk5s/Screenshot-2025-09-06-170630.png)
<br>
- Having too many seniors is always better than having too few seniors. In the worst case if you have a debate room full of juniors, and 2 extra seniors, these seniors can always at least guide the case prep of the juniors and cheer them on, even if they don't speak themselves.


Senior judge: junior participant ratio is a big deal. Often the debsoc doesn't even have 1 available senior for 6 juniors. Early on there are often too many juniors. One way to combat this is having more seniors. Another way is spreading out sessions even more (scheduling sessions according to the availability of the seniors rather than juniors), such that the juniors are spread out across different sessions, but the senior is available to repeat sessions on the different days.
It is a pain that having more juniors and less seniors means that seniors generally have to do more sessions than an average junior, but I haven't seen any way around this.

When more than one room full of juniors pull up (6-8 people), there are a few ways to adjust.
You can make the extra person adj a handful of times, but make sure they don't feel like they didn't matter. Even if it's AP, do deliberation with them and ask them questions, make them feel like they're exercising their debate muscle. 

When we had 8 people pull up to a session before we taught them BPs, I made two of them a fake reply speakers once. Basically a 4th person gave a 4-minute speech as a reply speech. 
When there were 7 people,  we just worked around with what we had, even if there was a reply speaker from one side but not the other side.

b) Choosing the optimal frequency of sessions. 
Adaptive sessions are more robust to spontaneity and the PES schedule. Having fixed sessions encourages the formation of a routine, and for people to fit it into their lifestyle, instead of consciously making the decision to go to debsoc every session. (Like how people don't even think about brushing their teeth as a burden anymore and just do it.)
Three days a week is what we usually go for once recruitments have ended. More sessions are usually too much work for the senior without proportional returns, and having less votes on the polls sort of sends a message that the debsoc is a deadsoc. 
I talk more about debate turnout as a whole in [Push to come to sessions](#push-to-come-to-sessions).


c) Another issue is the complications of adjing. This was initially a section under "Inside a Session", but my rant grew longer and longer and became a chapter of its own.

# Adj Rant
[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Encouraging Adjing is Complicated

[Link back to the 'Time' subsection if you came from the link there](#time)
### My Story
The debsoc controversy I am the most infamous for is my history with Adjudication. This was before CUPD 2023, my first tournament. My seniors put up a poll for speakers and adjudicators, and naturally everyone from my batch including me voted for speaking. 

2 weeks before the tournament, there were 4 of us who were still unsorted into the slots we had paid for. Our seniors were getting increasingly frustrated with us telling us, "How have you not decided your roles amongst yourselves yet?" As we freshers had never been to a tournament before, I expected our seniors to assign roles for us, but they seemed to avoid that responsibility. (I believe this is another underlying issue with the way we approach tournaments, giving 'freedom' without it really being freedom, and just leaving freshers clueless since there's no authority to back up a decision.)
The 4 of us continued to remain silent about which 3 would form a team and who would adj.

In an attempt to reach a decision, I texted, "Who wants to adj?" and nobody responded. Anyway my seniors saw it and the next debate session I was ripped apart. I said that since adjing was undesirable for everyone, they should have a fair system to select the adj, possibly spinning a wheel. I got told off for dissing on adjing and getting defensive (which is valid, I was), and was told that I'd be the adj (who saw this coming right). 

I had never been told that judges competed too, so I just felt like a bus driver for the real performers who were debaters. Being a forced adj for CUPD didn't get me to like adjing either.
For those who know me, things changed eventually, and I ended up adjing 3x more debates than I've spoken in.
Anyway, this highlights a couple problems with adjing.

---
### Adjing Obstacles

1. Adjing is seen as more undesirable than speaking by the vast majority of the circuit, as seen from:
- The constant requests on mixidea and 4crossmock where speaker slots have been filled up fast but nobody wants to voluntarily adj.
- The constant adj scarcity in tournaments where we beg OC to waive off adj slots, or beg juniors to adj.
2. If someone's adjing out of obligation, it's hard to set up a system of rotating adjes to be 'fair' with the burden of adjing. (As you can guess, this also negatively warps the [narrative of adjing](#the-adj-narrative).)
3. Adjing tournaments can disappoint freshers due to a multitude of reasons like:
- They were speakers for most debate sessions and so they haven't been trained to do this.
- They're likely to spend the whole tournament as a trainee, and hence
- - speakers scroll their phones during their OA and don't take them seriously,
- - people go to ask the chair feedback instead of them, and
- - they feel they have no presence in the tournament because their vote doesn't matter. 
-  They don't get any numerical result from the tournament either.
- Same things for BP except that they do the gruelling work of tracking 4 teams, only have 60 seconds to make a case, and they don't get the thrill of standing and giving a speech either.
- There's so much fun in debate with a teammate, and as an adj you feel lonely. There will never be people from PES in your room.
 - There's no real opportunity to talk to anyone either. You have your lunch alone during case prep time for the speakers. At least speaking teams get to chill with each other when judges are preparing their OA.
 - Adjing is boring and challenging with no thrilling payoff every round.(If you're a panelist one round and get panelist next round, you have no idea whether you judged well or not. At least speakers get their results instantly.)
 <br>![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/svJgvW5V/early-in-adjing-obstacles.jpg)
 
4. You usually can't go to a tournament as 6 speakers and no adj. So if one person is a designated adj, who's gonna adj and earn this person a speaking slot when they want to speak? If nobody steps up this person will be pushed to adj yet again.
5. At the CUPD that I spoke about, there were 4 teams with seniors, 1 team from us freshers, 1 senior adj, and 4 junior adjes. It looked like my seniors essentially 'used' us freshers to carry the burden of adjing so that they could enjoy the speaking slots which we opened up for them.
6. My seniors believed that freshers should compulsorily adj their first tournament. I think this is a good concept on paper, but the main issues are:
- A dozen freshers sign up for the first tournament available. It doesn't make sense to make all of them adj.
- The point of the initial tournament is to give juniors an experience so fun and insightful that juniors will want to continue debating and doing tournaments. Even if the grueling work of adjing 'builds character', they may not want to do a tournament ever again.
---
_One initial solution I had thought of a year ago, was to make people adj once every three or four tournaments._
- _This number was chosen because contingents usually can afford twice (BP) or thrice (AP) the number of speakers than adjes (when N=N), and mathematically the ratios match when people switch roles across tournaments._
- _Freshers will get to speak in their first two tournaments, and this will be enough for them to not quit even if their adjing experience sucked._ 
- _This also distributes adjes evenly among multiple tournaments._
- However, later I realized this was bad for the [narrative of adjing](#the-adj-narrative), and hence it was a bad idea. (The only way to still execute this is to equally say that _speaking_ twice in 3 tourneys is also 'compulsory', but this is too delicate and weird, and one slip-up ruins the narrative of adjing).
6. Freshers can't really adj during round 1 round 2 recruitments because they don't know what to judge to decide a winner, or how to analyze clashes. The thrill of speaking is way more than the thrill of listening, so to bait them into the debsoc they initially are made to speak.
7. How do you get them to switch to adjing if they have gotten used to speaking?

---
## The Adj Narrative

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Characterization

==**It's challenging but necessary, to be careful with every word to avoid propagating a negative narrative of adjing.**== The reason the narrative matters is because people are only ready to try something out if they believe it's good. An activity's perceived worth is heavily influenced by what society thinks of it. Even if a garbage collector enjoys collecting garbage, they may not enjoy their job if they're treated weirdly by society.

From the way my CUPD lore went down, it's clear that my initial bad impression of adjing just became worse after experiencing it. So most variations of 'compulsory' adjing are likely to be destructive. 


The ideal scenario is an organic shift to adjing. Maybe they'll want to try something new, try adjing, and end up liking it. (A handful of people have actually told me that they want to try adjing in the next session.)
The ideal scenario of tournaments is if people voluntarily adj and power through all the disheartening parts of it. The Debsoc in 2023 was blessed to have multiple people voluntarily and passionately adj tournaments, removing one of the biggest burdens of tournaments. I had never seen this phenomenon in my 2 years of debate till then, and still mildly hold the belief today that this happened due to random chance.


How do we make sure this trend continues?
- Already having the trend is a good start. My seniors lacking adjes and avoiding judging themselves was what pushed the narrative that adjing was undesirable. Currently there is a nice trend of debsoc seniors voluntarily judging, which makes it look desirable.
- The target audience of people who may like adjing more than speaking, needs to be aware of the full benefits of adjing. What are the reasons these people get into adjing in the first place?
- + I know someone who got into adjing because they were too afraid to speak.
- + I know someone who judges when they're too exhausted to speak.
- + I know people who end up judging all the time because they're late all the time.
- + I know people who equally feel like judging/speaking, and because they're the only one among 7 people who feel that way, they're made a judge.
- + People may feel used to having no case due to no knowledge of the world. Judging seems more comfortable to them because judges are _given_ the content to speak on. (A major reason I prefer judging.)
- + Some more positive reasons to judge are because people like the way their brain is use during judging, and how challenging it is.
- + **The interesting thing about the narrative of freshers early on before they judge, is that judging looks like a position of authority.** Freshers believe that you need to be highly qualified to be a judge, and that being a judge is a sign of you being great (They're unaware that anyone can judge at a tournament). 
- I don't know how exactly to encourage adjing (because if you start outright telling everyone "adjing is nice, do try it out", it looks like you're a scamster. Anything that is actually good doesn't need explicit endorsement.) If judging is actually fun, everybody should be trying to do it, so promotion of judging looks suspicious.
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/xSwn9pdD/Whats-App-Image-2025-09-09-at-23-10-53.jpg)
- However, I have a few possible [ideas](#elevating-the-judging-experience) on how you might improve a fresher's enjoyment of judging mocks. 
- Even if you can't safely encourage adjing, what is definitely important, is to avoid _discouraging_ adjing. Members of the debsoc have often made statements which ruin the narrative of adjing (me included), and we need to be careful.

Samuel, my senior, once said this to encourage judging,

"Also, I notice a lot of you love speaking and I couldn't be glader [_sic_] you're all eager to debate. However do note that Adjudication/Judging is equally important for the following reasons:
1) Adjudicating is also a competition in tournaments, and speakers rate you on your Oral Adjudication (OA).
2) It's easier to break (qualify to playoffs), as an adjudicator than a speaker.
3) The prize money for adjes is obscene - 10-20k ez for best adjes at big tournaments.
4) Adjing makes you a better debater, because you analyse the debate from a neutral perspective and have to do all aspects from framing to weighing, making you well rounded.
5) It's a great way to get rep in the circuit and become highly respected. A lot of career adjes are some of the most respected people in the circuit.
All in all, try and balance the both when you come for practice, that way you become a more well rounded debater. Cheers :)"

He carefully framed his encouragement by suggesting that "the only reason you speak more than you judge is because you haven't tried it out" and that's why they needed the encouragement to try it out, which was a smart move. (It doesn't suffer as much from the flaw of suspicious marketing.)
_If you try to replicate this text, some nuances might be missed, leading to a flop._

**I think it's vital to inform people that judges also compete at tournaments, because we don't consciously inform this to new recruits. Someone new to debate would also never know that judges compete as well, so they're usually ignorant of this fact until their first tournament. This information shows that judging is a challenge worth pursuing, and makes people care about becoming better judges.** (If new debaters don't know that judges compete, then why would they want to register as an adj at a tournament.)

However, a few issues from Sam's text are
- "easier to break" isn't necessarily true, and I'm unsure about the messaging that people should try it because it's easy.
- The judge prize money isn't that accurately portrayed (only the big tournaments are talked about and not the average ones), and winning a prize feels like a speculative impact to a lot of people.
- Sam missed out on all the benefits IAs and SAs get. If you want to market judging financially to people, **tell them about how colleges in Bangalore like NLS and Christ pay people, quite ordinary SA level people to come judge for them.** I got 5k once to judge NLS (Even though I have never broken at a tournament) and I was super happy about judging. (Okay, NLS has gotten way stricter recently, and the only reason I got that 5k judging gig is because Samuel, the original invitee, dipped out at the last minute.)

### Common Pitfalls

**Trends get pushed in micro ways. It's difficult to avoid being a conduit yourself.** 
- I remember when one of my seniors was coming to a session after a long time, and when I asked them to adj, they replied, "I'm not coming to a session after so long to _adj_".

- Making people judge when they come late seems like a 'punishment'. When they show up as the 7th person, they might say something like, "Aw man, I'm judging today?!" and we might impulsively say, "If you want to speak, then come earlier next time," as an effort to make them punctual. 
- Even actions with positive intent can be destructive. Profusely thanking someone for agreeing to your judge can be destructive ("Thank you so so so much for making a huge sacrifice and agreeing to judge my mock/judge for this tournament"), because they further the narrative that adjing is undesirable.
- If you have a strict bar for people to participate in tourneys (inactive people cannot come to tourneys), you might be tempted to lower the bar for someone who wants to adj, saying, "We really need an adj, we'll take you to Bombay with us even if you have been inactive", which further pushes the undesirability of adjing.
---
- Page 38 and 40 of the book I mentioned earlier, [Empowering University Debate Clubs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAni64_JD4Uu6N00kryFs0j_W7q1Heeb/view) puts it into words better than I ever can. (Page 38 is about the difficult task of getting seniors to judge juniors, which I'd recommend checking out.) Here are some very relevant excerpts from page 40:
- - Sometimes societies struggle with finding people willing to judge and opt for a rotating system. This usually enforces an obligation to judge one time per three to four debates. This system is good for egalitarian treatment and makes sure no one feels like they are being pressured into judging too much. In small societies with just a few qualified judges, this system-approach allows for new people to quickly get into judging. The advice would be to ask the good judges to chair the first few months with different new people as wings before going fully into the system to keep the judging level consistent. However, this system can make judging seem like “a chore” to earn “the reward” of debate. It forces people to keep track of how many people have debated and can decrease judging quality if a big pool of novices is involved. A hybrid system of rotating systems (rather informally) and encouraging narratives and activities can prevent the cons of this approach.
> Furthermore, it should be emphasized that judging is just a part of debating and it is a great opportunity to provide feedback to help your friends and fellow debaters improve. Rather than seeing it as an act of service, it should be presented as a given, not to create narratives of judging being a “duty” and debating a “reward”.

Although this is nice in principle, it's very idealistic and hides a lot of difficulty behind the phrase, '(rather informally)'. It's hard to ensure that such narratives around judging are created exactly the way we wish. "Presented as a given" sounds a lot like, "compulsory".

### Elevating The Judging Experience
Adjudication only started to truly be fulfilling to me when I could feel the value I was providing.
- I was the sole third year student holding sessions, and I felt valued since sessions couldn't run without me (narcissist). 
- I wasn't a 'useless trainee' judge anymore, but now a chair who people depended on.
- I felt this 'value' when juniors asked me for feedback on getting better. It made me feel like I was the shit, the man (narcissist again).

~~This is starting to get into the territory of altruism being selfish, which is a debate of its own.~~

Since they aren't fully qualified to give feedback, these motivations don't work for inexperienced judges. How then do we get them to enjoy judging?

The two ways juniors judge are:
1. As a panel to a senior chair
2. As a chair, a sole judge, when the senior present decides to speak instead

I think there are primarily 2 ways to replicate a portion of this feeling that I had:
1. **If you're the chair, make the junior feel like their thoughts are heard.** 
2. **If you're a speaker, ask this junior judge for feedback. This isn't something we do normally because we don't see much gain for ourselves. However, it can still help to know how an ordinary person would interpret your speech. 
It works wonders for a junior's enjoyment of judging, because they feel proud about their opinion being valued by a senior. They might say things like, "I don't know how to judge, this is my first time, don't ask me", but get it out of them regardless, by saying that you value their words, you value the fact that they sat through your 1 hour yap, a judge is a judge, etc.**

Unlike speakers whose words are paid attention to and talked about in an OA, Trainees often feel insignificant. Make sure they enjoy judging, and make sure they feel that they're contributing, and they matter. 

_However, I wouldn't recommend getting the fresher to give an OA to everyone because people might follow incorrect advice from them. What I did, was ask this panelist to give their OA privately to just me._ 
- _However, if you think you can interrupt their OA and catch them on every mistake or misleading piece of feedback, and prevent harm to the other fresher speakers, then you can go for public OAs._ 
- + _However, interrupting is also annoying. To avoid this, you might decide make a mental note of their mistakes and tell them later. This flaw in this solution is that you're also quite likely to forget your mental notes._

(That's it for these 3 confusing lines of a problem to a solution to a problem to a solution to a problem to a solution to a problem to a solution.)

# How to resolve Debsoc Drama
You're cooked. I'm just as clueless as you.

---
# Tournaments

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When I joined the Debsoc, parliamentary debate was starkly different from what I considered debates to be. It seemed quite formal for no reason, and adding 'characterization, mechanization, weighing' seemed like unnecessary 'formalities'. I didn't see how this made cases more persuasive, and I thought the debsoc was weird for engaging in some weird format of debate. I wondered if the debsoc just blindly followed 'rituals'. 

Going to a tournament finally made all of this feel 'real'. The reason why we stuck to APs and BPs instead of other fun debate formats, is because these were the formats which the world used for tournaments. Seeing judges from different colleges talk about mechanization and weighing made me realize that the techniques my club seniors followed were actually valid. Parliamentary debate no longer felt like a made-up game with arbitrary rules.

Once you do a tournament, you often get motivation by having a milestone to work for, rather than an abstract aim like, "speaking better".

The major differences between tournaments and mocks are:
Stakes, dedicated days for debate, and the increased depth and breadth of the community (more time with more friends).

Aaaaaand the money.

## Freeloaders

By freeloaders I mean people who don't participate in the debsoc much yet want to join reimbursements.
For quite a few years, the debsoc has tried to prevent freeloaders, but sometimes we've found it hard to say no to people. 

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/rKY6GKfn/Whats-App-Image-2025-09-09-at-23-25-35.jpg)


When the debsoc tries to send a lot of people to a tournament and asks for reimbursements, the management sometimes makes it an issue and asks the soc to cut names. 
Sometimes while applying for reimbursements, we try to limit people in the application because we fear that if we initially have too many people, instead of telling us to cut people, they might reject reimbursement for the tournament entirely. Sometimes they reject tournaments if you've gone to other tournaments recently.
I don't have experience communicating between students and the management, so I can't really tell how to work with the management (but Stuthi has, and she has words for you in the next section).

Basically, tournament reimbursement slots are kind of limited. Every slot is hard-earned by the clubheads or whoever communicates to the management. 

You might want to use tournaments to incentivize people to come to sessions. Whatever stance you take on 'freeloaders,' the hardest part is sticking to it.
It's awkward to tell people you know, your friends, that they don't meet the bar to attain reimbursement. But standing your ground sets a precedent for the future that your actions are in line with your words, and this affects how seriously your future words are taken as well.

If it's an official rule you will publicize, make sure you know the answers to all the clauses. 
What if someone was active earlier but is inactive now? What if there's a tournament with only a few interested people, so slots aren't really limited then, can this person benefit from reimbursement? What if this person met the bar to go to previous tournaments yet isn't active enough for this one? What if someone interacts on the group and helps the community, but doesn't debate at sessions? What if the person is a skilled debater and is your best chance at getting a title?

Are you banning freeloaders, deprioritizing them, or letting everyone in? 

What we did once for an irregular debater, was to only reimburse half their amount. We got to keep your conscience in check while also letting people know that being regular has perks.

## Tournament Registration

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The first time you forward a tournament advertisement post to freshers, make sure to state that they shouldn't click on the google form link and register by themselves (a common honest mistake otherwise). 

For their first tourney, most freshers won't know each other, and so you might be left with 4 people with no teammate preference. In this case it makes sense to assign teams yourself. 
In the future, you don't have to worry about this. People will have friends they want to do tourneys with, and will sign up as pairs/trios. 
What we sometimes do, is send a poll with a speaker option and an adjudicator option. I think this system is flawed for reasons I said in my [adj rant](#my-story), and maybe it would be better to just ask for participants and decide the speaker-adj split later. This split is awkward for the reasons I mentioned in [my story](#my-story), but unless you're able to get an adj waiver or have enough voluntary adjes in the soc, you're going to have to deal with this issue somehow.

Early reg is ideal, but it's often really hard because there are so many steps like people asking their parents, reimbursement mails, etc.
Since reimbursement gets confirmed very late (often after the tournament reg closes), we usually tell people, "There's a chance of reimbursement, but no guarantee, so register only if you can handle no reimbursement."

---
It's absolutely necessary to collect money from everybody _**before**_ paying the sum total to the tournament organizers. 
- Otherwise, someone might drop out due to unforeseen reasons after you've already paid their share, and there's no way to really get your money back from them. 
- - You have to struggle to find a replacement which is rarely possible because everyone interested will already have registered. 
- If someone has paid you already, they're less likely to drop out because the money has already been spent.

## Words from Stuthi

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

So, when they wanna reject reimbursement, there's 2 ways: 
1 is they ghost you (which is pretty rare) and 
2 the vc directly says no and vk sir informs us. 

So I'd say that you shouldn't like put it in a bracket that they ghost us if it's a rejection cause ghosting is super rare and we have never actually been ghosted (except if you count the nls situation, which we did get a verbal rejection at least twice but we still tried on email 3 times cause we greedy like that)

If you don't get a reply on the mail, it's because the mail got lost in vk sirs inbox, so if you send a reminder or go talk to him personally, it'll be okay.

One tip I have to make sure any staff (especially the slow people down in accounts) are friendly with you and work with you, is to speak with them in Kannada. You don't need to predominantly speak only in Kannada, but whenever I felt like they were shutting down when I needed help with something I'd throw in a sentence or two in Kannada and they would suddenly be helpful again.

The process for doing things keep changing regularly, so I think it's always better for the heads to make a doc exclusively for them as per the needs of that particular year. And always take photos of whatever letter or form you're submitting. So many times the accounts people have asked me to show them the reimbursement form, and when I didn't have the picture, the money would take way longer to come in.

Wait max 2 weeks for vk sir himself to tell you the reimbursement check is in (he'll send a text in the group). If he doesn't, go to the accounts dept yourself cause the people have buried your form somewhere in hell. Do not leave until they dig it out in front of you.

If the reimbursement amount is particularly high and chances of getting it seem slim, then highlight your most recent achievements in the mail you send. Give them a reason to spend a crap ton of money on you.

And one thing to always remember: Never make grammatical and formatting errors in anything. You will have to redo the whole thing. Personal experience. Vk sir actually sees everything and is very particular about this. Even in the most insignificant mails, if he finds something wrong, he'll point it out and let you know kindly.

Note from Stuthi for the 'resolving drama' section:
I would say the best thing is to have a third party, like a senior, get involved, hear out both sides, and try to bring peace, because in all the fights we have had, I regret never actually discussing my issues with the people I had issues with. We only discussed among each other and that was probably the worst thing one can do. Bharath did get involved with us, but it was mostly us venting and him listening and telling us where he thought we were in the right and wrong. He did talk to the juniors [the ones involved on the other side of the drama] sometimes, but I think the best thing would be to have all parties present with a couple sensible seniors who can moderate.

End of Stuthi (no she's alive as of September 14 2025)

## Tournament Briefing

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Freshers are often intimidated at their first tournament, due to being unaware of the place, unaware of the system, unaware of Tabbycat, etc, and look for a senior to guide them through the weekend.

For newcomers, the reality of a debate tournament often differs starkly from their expectations. If you don't educate juniors on the tournament experience, then
- They might reach home later than they told their parents to expect them.
- They might delay food expecting a lunch break, and then miss out on eating food at all, if you haven't told them the strategic time to eat food.
- Numerous logistical issues can arise, such as all members of a team filling duplicate feedback, trainees being confused about filling the ballot, waiting for the OA during the silent round, various other Tabbycat issues like navigating on your private url, different forms of check-in, etc.
- They might expect the tournament to provide food so they wouldn't have made their own food plans like lunch boxes.
- And most of all, won't know the meaning of the word imminent.

One briefing session before their first tournament where you talk about the logistics and equity can go a long way. It's also nice to drive hard the point that the experience, the learning, and the fun matter far more than points. 

---
The biggest difference between expectations and reality is of course, that juniors are used to interschool science quizzes (where most people score high) and they won't have really comprehended that this is a national level tournament with people years elder to them.
"Most novices go into their first tournament assuming they'll only face other beginners, only to get ripped apart by dinos in the first round.

Tournaments are very draining physically, mentally, and emotionally. Juniors have no idea how likely it is to go back home with 0 points or 1 point. This has happened multiple times before and has left them absolutely devastated (to be fair it has happened in APs not BPs). I think they deserve a fair warning.
I believe that it was better to prepare them for this possibility rather than being blindly optimistic about their results. However, this is something specific to my beliefs and the way I see the world, so I'm unsure whether it's better to act like you have low expectations of them, or high. If your expectations are high, people will feel like their performance was far lower than what it should have been, and that they disappointed you. But if your expectations are low then that could affect their self-esteem from the start since that makes them, "hopeless".

## Tournament Spirits

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Due to different rooms ending at times, it's hard to execute this, getting everyone to congregate at a designated spot after every round to chill together is vital to tournament vibes. Without a contingent people often end up feeling lost and lonely. (I guess this hampers their ability to stay talking to new people, so this is vital primarily to people who are awkward with strangers.)
I've talked [earlier](#adjing-obstacles) about how judges feel extremely lonely at tournaments. Meeting them, asking about their round, and asking about how they felt they did, is doubly as impactful to judges who yearn for someone to listen to them (especially since speakers rarely do). 

In groups that emerge, a few juniors are often left out of the conversation. Seniors usually know each other and have easy conversation, whereas juniors find it difficult to barge in, and hence feel left out. Seniors intentionally involving every junior into conversation goes a long way. Simply acknowledging their existence goes a long way. (I know I've had tournaments where I felt invisible and like my presence didn't matter.)

---
If the disappointment of participants builds up after every round, they may never want to do a tournament (or even debate) again. Creating good experiences can be done in a myriad of ways like taking fun pictures, dropping lore (Debate lore or even PES lore), asking them to drop their lore, playing card games, and roaming around the campus or the city. 

I find conditional extra hyped stakes like, "If you don't break, you're kicked from the soc," to be in bad taste. Even if it's obvious as a joke, it drives the narrative that the seniors have expectations on you, and if you don't meet them, you're a disappointment. (I'm typing this fresh as a junior randomly texted me saying sorry for disappointing me (It appears I wasn't successful enough in telling them that results don't matter to me)).

We've had traditions like, "The tab topper at this tournament will be given[^2] brownies", but I don't know how far that really motivates people's performance, or how it impacts their emotions post the tournament when they achieve it and when they don't.
Sure, it does feel necessary to reward the ones who put effort, and the common way to measure the effort put in, is by the output, but these people already get enough dopamine hits in my opinion.

[^2]: These people sometimes didn't even receive their brownies lmao

---
### Breaks

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/JwzPPn3J/novice-speaker.jpg)

Breaks are when emotional turbulence is at a high since it's the culmination of the stakes of the whole tournament. Break announcements starkly divide people into the elated and the crestfallen. 

Congratulating your friends who broke is a great display of contingent spirit. It's great to be proud because we've all trained together and supported each other on the journey of debate.

The people who haven't broken, both the people who narrowly missed out and the people who aren't even close, feel a tinge of sadness amid this celebration. It's important for a senior to be aware and to tend to these people by providing reassurance and comfort. People feel really low after tourneys especially since in their head, the score next to their team is the most objective measurement of their skill. It sucks to have worked so hard but still be graded terribly.

---
A few people including me believe glorifying the speaker score is useless and does more harm than good. As I've said in [Feedback](#feedback), speaker scores are something people believe to be an accurate measurement, but in reality, fluctuate to the point where they're unreliable. The main 'insight' people derive from a speaker score is who the superior teammate was and who the inferior teammate was. Regular scores can be blamed on the 'team's case' or the 'team's synergy', but speaker scores feel especially harsh because the blame is on you. 


Glorifying one person's speaker score for being the best speaker is kinda an insult to their teammate. 
Pragmatically, the good that you can claim comes out of this is that, "The speaker feels honored for the work they've done," and "People get inspired to be like them." But the speaker usually feels happy enough already with whatever other result they have achieved. If you really want to make them happy, cheering in their private messages covers it.
(Ngl writing this stuff also makes me cringe and I wanna delete it.)

Other people are also 'inspired enough' anyway to debate. Glorifying someone else is unlikely to result in extra effort from them and can result in them just feeling even worse about themselves. Sure, juniors aren't snowflakes, but there's no real point in hurting their self-esteem when they're already bruised from the tournament. It's normal for humans to feel sad when it comes to something they care about.

For so long I had felt jealous of people being congratulated, but when me and my teammate were on the receiving side, we didn't really find the glorification to be that special. It didn't have an actual impact on our actual happiness, and I felt pity for the ones on the other side.

## Online Tournaments

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The target audience for online tournaments is people who do tourneys to grind debate, even without the fun of the tournament experience. Hence, as time goes on, the only people who participate are the hardcore ones.

Initially though, online tournaments are popular with juniors since they get to do a tournament without investing 3k rupees.
I wouldn't want juniors to start with an online tournament with zero fun, since this could lead them believe that all debate tournaments are like this.
So if you end up sending them to an online tournament before an offline one, try to make it as offline as possible.
The most memorable online tournament for me has been SBS from early 2024. We all met up together offline on both days, debated together, ate together, dropped lore together, and had a fun time (primarily because of Samuel the jester). 

---
### Online Tournament Logistics

PES WiFi sometimes randomly blocks and unblocks discord. Sometimes even when discord is unblocked, voice calls on discord are blocked (but voice calls on Google Meet aren't blocked). So try to test everyone's systems early at the tournament.

The major accessible spots at PES with Wi-fi are the GJB library, the GJB cafeteria, and the 13th floor at PES. (When our clubhead was the CCBD head, we once sat in the CCBD lab and debated.)
The places you can debate in the GJB library are the small brainstorming rooms, but unfortunately only one team can fit in one of these rooms at a time (because otherwise two teams may talk over each other). Since you can't get together as a contingent, I wouldn't recommend this. Moreover, this place isn't open on Sundays.

The GJB cafeteria has like 3 power sockets. I'd recommend this place only as a last resort. It's usually deserted on Saturdays and Sundays, so you can enter and turn the lights on yourself.  

What I find to be the best place is the 13th floor of B block (heavy favoritism tbh). Debating in the indoors section usually isn't feasible because either there are people you'll disturb, or it's locked. There are 3 sections outdoors; the cafeteria, the place next to the cafeteria on the other side of the throne, and a spot with wide long tables on the opposite side of 13th floor (next to the faculty zone, on the other side of the silent room). 
These are fairly empty on Saturday and Sunday. AND ALL OF THEM HAVE MULTIPLE POWER SOCKETS!!

---
How to access 13th floor:

Security guards might tell you that it's closed when you enter B block. Reply (Obviously talk to the security in Kannada) to this saying that you're not going inside, you'll just be outdoors. 
If they say that it's restricted, tell them that the Debate Club is doing an online competition here, just like they have been doing for the last 2 years.  
If all else fails, say that you know a security guard named Shankar. If Shankar is there, tell him that you're the kids of Srijan. 😂😂

Don't let these instructions give you the wrong impression, they'll usually let you in without asking any questions. Just don't have one boy and one girl enter together. Always go in larger groups or one by one.

You're allowed to order food to PES, collect it at the main gate, bring it up to 13th floor and eat there.

### Cafe Down The Alley


This was our regular post-session hangout spot back in 2023, 
but the last time I went here was after the online tournament Mukhtalif.

Online tournaments can severely lack fun. At Mukhtalif, since I was busy with my OAs, it was hard for me to engage with people post their debates. By round 4 everyone wanted to quit round 5.
I reached out to shenanigans 5.0 and they gave me the idea of chilling at Cafe Down The Alley. (They still gave us thumbs up to quit round 5 lol.)

This was a great idea because Cafe Down The Alley has food and great games. 
Some people played Chess, some played Uno (I'll hate Debsoc Uno till my dying day because nobody agrees on the rules), and we played Jenga, the greatest group game found there (because it's so fun to struggle to remove a block, then breath relief, and laugh as the next player struggles more). 

The food is on the pricier side and they unfortunately seem to no longer have a discount for PES students.

I like how it's still able to simulate the fun chill vibe of acco(hotels) at offline tournaments. It also has the novelty of going out instead of staying at PES.

# Debate Culture Round the Year
[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Push to come to sessions

The question the debsoc will forever grapple with is, "How do we get people to come to sessions?"

![enter image description here](https://www.davelabowitz.com/wp-content/uploads/Sisyphus-e1557869810488.jpg)

School teachers get to be strict to get results out of students because the students can't really quit school. Being strict in the Debsoc and causing bad vibes just pushes people to avoid it all.
The stance my seniors adopted in 2022 was one involving fear. Everyone was supposed to vote on the poll (well, actually fill a google form because Whatsapp didn't have the poll feature at the time). If they were missing out on that session, they had to "DM one of the heads with a very valid reason". 
One night on a discord voice call, our seniors tested our debate knowledge. We got shit on for not knowing the full form of THP even after a year in the club. 
When numbers of attendees dropped, we were called to serious meetings. The constant threat we heard was that if we didn't attend enough sessions, we'd be kicked out of the club. 

At the time I was apathetic about late night online sessions, and I adopted the stance of, "Oh if they want to kick me out so badly, I'm fine getting kicked". (And the rest is history.)

---
Fear is an ineffective motivator, especially when the consequence is simply an outcome their inaction is already causing. This 'punishment' intuitively doesn't make sense. The intuitive assumption is that anyone who cares about being in the club would also care enough to attend debates, because that's the point. Why would people want to be in a club without enjoying the activity and wanting to participate in the core activity of the club? 
By the way, there are actually a few possible answers to this question
1. It's in the back of their mind, and they always mull about coming, but they never bring themselves to come. Other things take priority.
2. They want to be in a club for the sake of it because it's cool. (There are people who get excited about buying debsoc merch even though they don't debate anymore or even feel like even a part of the club.)
![image](https://i.ibb.co/Y929MpB/Screenshot-2025-09-06-162019.png)
3. They have issues on weekdays but not weekends.
4. They want to do tournaments because they are super fun, but don't want to attend sessions which aren't that fun. (Surprisingly a very common scenario I've observed).

It's hard to entirely solve these problems. The best you can do is keep the value of sessions high, and also do things like Cubbon Park sessions.

---
A few random concepts that I've learned the hard way:
- A lot of people, in their head, will feel guilty about coming to debate, because they 'should be studying instead'. During a banal session they may think that they 'could have been studying instead'. People always imagine that if they got 2 hours extra in a day, they would spend those hours studying. Even if people do end up passing the time anyway on their short days, the fantasy of this productivity is enough to discourage them from walking to a debate session. 
- Regardless of how much value debate adds to life, nobody thinks that it's more productive than studying. Second year onwards, the main reason people still find the drive to come is because of the community. Debate culture is a testament to the community you've built. People should be _tempted_ to come debate. 
- The only reason college students do anything besides studies is when something feels fun, or if it's what they visualized themselves doing in their college life. People may come to debate sessions because it helps them pursue their dream of, "having a fun college life", the same way that people hang out with their friends regardless of their academic commitments.

The activity of the Debsoc should be kept visible and fresh, even in the minds of the people who don't come debate. From my experience sitting at home these last few months, session polls don't give me a sense of how alive the soc is. Only other conversation about the session does.
Share the motion on the WhatsApp group (not the Sessions group because that prevents free-flowing conversation since people cannot reply to it), share random fun pictures of the people at the session, maybe share the names of the people at the session if there are quite a few people. This really makes people feel like they're missing out and that there's something thriving which other people are enjoying.

---
Akshat Saxena once told me, "To ignite passion in the juniors, seniors need to show their own passion and how debate obsessed they are." This shows that debate is something people find fun enough, valuable enough, to spend their time in, even when they have other priorities. Seeing other people with an opinion of debate being valuable makes juniors feel like the right opinion, the normal opinion, the socially validated opinion is to enjoy debate. On the flip side, seniors avoiding sessions pushes the narrative that, "Debate is something everyone stops eventually." Making something feel temporary gives less reason for a junior to invest time and energy to work towards a long-term debate goal.

---
We learned the hard way that inertia is a powerful force, and a sustained period of inactivity can be detrimental. People get comfortable with patterns and routines. Try to have some debate scene in vacations like online sessions or Cubbon park, and try to start debating the moment a new academic semester starts. The first 2 weeks  of college are crucial to break the inertia, because once assignments start rolling in, it's really hard to break the routine of 'not debating'. On the flip side, if people have started debating every Tuesday and Wednesday, they'll find it easy to continue this routine.

If you have successfully made juniors believe that tournaments are fun as hell, and if you really need an external motivator to get people to come to sessions, then tournaments work well as your carrot. Only allowing people who consistently show up is the only real incentive you can control, it's one of the few bits of leverage you have (well I suppose you can gatekeep Debsoc merchandise too for only the active debaters lol). 

![enter image description here](https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/021/392/820/original/incentive-reward-or-bonus-to-motivate-employee-on-hard-working-to-reach-success-company-benefit-job-promotion-or-employee-program-concept-business-people-run-on-giant-hand-to-grab-carrot-stick-vector.jpg)

This also makes the reward feel valuable to someone because they earned it, they were chosen for this slot because of their dedication to the soc. As long as this threat of no freeloading is followed, it remains as an incentive since there are tournaments around the year. If you were ineligible for one tournament you can just earn the reward of the next tournament.
The drawback here is that this makes Debsoc sessions look like a chore, but at least people will come to a session and then remember how fun sessions are. (Like some people who experience the thrill of solving an academic question, yet still procrastinate starting to solve the questions.) It also makes people feel like they're working towards something, every session is bringing them closer to a tournament.

(We did this occasionally and made it such that if you didn't qualify for a tournament but really wanted to come, you could pay out of your own pocket. The Debsoc didn't owe you money because you weren't really a contributing member to the soc, since you didn't assist in its activity through sessions.)

## Informal recruitments

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Informal recruitments, also known as lateral entry, is the entry of people into the debate society even after official recruitments have concluded. Recruitments usually conclude right at the end of the shared odd semester (the portion that's shared between seniors and the first sem of juniors), since the semester is packed with bootstrap, Aarohi (the club showcase for freshers), round 1, round 2, round 3, and then the exams of seniors almost immediately after that. 
The real time that you get after the main recruitment is the shared even semester (after the sem 1 exams of freshers), which is the right time to encourage lateral entry.

---

During regular recruitments, a lot of recruits show up with their friends who just come to spend time with them, not debate. Sometimes these friends are unsure if they're even allowed. Encourage these friends to stay and watch/participate as a swing (if they don't want to join the club)/chill. People have fun engaging in an activity like debating, alongside or against their friends. Friends who join the soc together, often egg each other on to come to Debsoc later too. (To be fair, sometimes when one friend leaves the soc, their friend leaves the soc too, but we do have cases where the friend who was dragged into the soc ended up being the one who stayed.)
A major reason people find it difficult to come to sessions after classes is feeling they'd rather spend that time with their friend. Bringing the friend along solves that issue.

---
Spectating should be counted as interest even for regular recruitments, because people are investing their time and exercising their debate muscle. Heck, even walking down to the basement is an indicator of interest.
Every year there are people initially anxious about speaking in front of strangers. **Let them know** that spectating is an option, instead of putting the responsibility on them to build up the courage to ask you if they can spectate. A lot of spectators do get converted into debaters, and these people would have been missed out on if they only had the option to directly debate.

---
#### What causes the need of informal recruitments?

- A lot of people may not have heard of the debsoc at the start of recruitments, or even if they had, they may not have felt that it was a good club worth pursuing. They may have been too wrapped up with the start of college and now have clarity on how they want to pursue clubs.
- Most such people get interested in the debsoc because their friend sings them praises of the Debsoc.
- If these people are made to wait until the official recruitments next year, it might be too late to hook them into debating (because a majority of freshers drop out of the club when the academic grind steepens in the 3rd sem). By the next sem, maybe even their friend drops out, and they aren't invested enough in debating to care to continue without this friend.

---
#### What are the benefits of informal recruitments?
- It lessens the load on the swarm of recruitments the next year.
- **It really helps with the activity of the soc in the even sem.** Even if people haven't entirely dropped out of the club yet, hardly 10% of the people show up to 1 session a week by the time the even semester rolls around. At this point the atmosphere really gets subdued if there are only 3 people at an average session. **At a time like this, fresh blood is crucial to rejuvenate the soc.** (Yes the Debsoc is a big vampire.) With informal recruits, you get to do full APs again, you get to keep activity going and make the people on Whatsapp feel like they're missing out, and you prevent the full death of the club. 

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/RGVgZkcN/Whats-App-Image-2025-09-10-at-00-11-01.jpg)

- If the average debate tenure of people is 8 months, then when you don't have your old recruits to help you conduct the next recruitments, you'll usually at least have these people to help you (since they haven't reached the 8-month boredom point). 
- Even if they seem temporary and you think they'll leave soon (because they didn't care enough to come to the actual recruitments), their help in keeping the society alive is valuable to keep the flow of the other members going.

---
#### How do we usually carry out informal recruitments?
- (What we usually _don't_ do, is inform people that this is even possible. Hence, we only get a small number of people who have either pushed their request through their friends or have gotten their hands on the contact number of the clubhead and pestered them.) This is enormous work on their part, and it should become way easier than this for someone to opt in. 
Most people don't even know this is possible because the natural assumption of an ignorant first year is that people can only get recruited during recruitments. Even if they want to reach out, they don't, because they don't see the point of the attempt. 
- Please be one step better than us and announce to everyone that their friends can get recruited into the soc. **Being proactive instead of reactive is pretty much the theme of this document.**
- This doesn't require a whole dedicated phase of recruitments because there won't be that many people to cater to. 
- We may still need to make sure people feel like they earned their way into the club, so a bar to get in may be necessary.
- I usually set the bar of attendance to be like 4 sessions, and once they surpass that, they get into Shenanigans.
- People like Harikeshav, Nahush, Gokul, Aditya Chaitanya, Tusti, started off by spectating debates before proceeding to debate themselves. I believe spectating should be counted as attendance (like I've said previously).
- A few people who undergo informal recruitments are the people who barely missed the bar in round 3, and still expressed desire to join when I reached out to them. I keep the bar a little lower for them since they had already debated a little. I'm glad to see many of them are still debating today, 6 months later, and did NALSAR too, like Shubhangi, Akshay Gudur, and Akshith. (I made extra sessions for them during the regular recruitment semester itself.)

### Cubbon Park
Holding a couple Cubbon Park Sessions in a year is a Debsoc tradition.
The vibes of Cubbon are unattainable on regular days at PES. Cubbon sessions have way more turnout also because 
1. More of Bangalore lives closer to Cubbon Park than PES
2. People have more free time on the weekends.

Cubbon Park is usually scheduled for a Saturday or Sunday. One time when people were split between Saturday and Sunday, we did both, but that was too exhausting.
As I mention later, the opportunities for Cubbon Park sessions are rare so you should grab them when you can. Vacation time may seem ideal but you're bound to miss out on hostelites who've gone home. Holding them a few times a year keeps them accessible to everyone.

Every Cubbon, there have been 2 groups of people who show up to Cubbon sessions: people who want to debate, and people who want to play. The needs of one group get compromised. We end up playing eventually anyway, but we usually precede this with a debate.
We've played kabaddi, dog and the bone, mafia, and card games.

The most frustrating part of Cubbon has been the arrival. People at their first Cubbon session won't know the usual debsoc spot. Clear instructions like, "Get off at BR Ambedkar station" are crucial because most people assume that the proximate station is Cubbon Park. The best landmark, more than the dog park, is the Library, because it's a building that can be seen from afar. Even with all these instructions, people get lost all the time because it's Cubbon, so maybe a video walkthrough could help. Session delay at PES is nothing compared to Cubbon sessions. People come late because it's a weekend too. Deciding when to start the debate/activity, and how long you're ready to wait, is crucial to minimize the frustration of people who come with certain expectations and time constraints. (People often feel frustrated when they put effort to come early but no activity starts until the latecomers show up.)

### Beyond The Debates

Circles get formed in hangouts quite often. These circles can be both physical with body posture, or metaphysical, where a new or rare fresher is excluded.  People direct their conversation towards their friends, and people on the outside find it awkward to join a conversation among people who already know each other.
Putting extra effort to talk to everyone so that they don't feel like they're part of an 'outgroup' can be quite impactful. (Unfortunate that you've read this already in the Tournament section, but I didn't feel like cutting it.)

![enter image description here](https://www.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/picpath/2015-12-02-feeling-alone.jpg)

A good way to make people feel valued is to remember them by their name, call them by their name, make some reference to a thing they had said on a previous day, etc. This makes them feel less like they're invisible and more like they had some impact on the people of Debsoc.

---

**It's great to talk about how you went through the same struggles that they're going through now,** had a love-hate relationship with debate, how your confidence oscillated, how you always forgot impacting, how you used to fumble glorification, narrative, and THR motions, and how everything made you want to quit. This empathy significantly helps them feel normal and feel less shit about themselves. Juniors look up to you and see you as someone they want to become, and showing that you're human makes them feel more confident. We don't always tell them this consciously, and doing it proactively ensures that we comfort more people and comfort them earlier.

---

By the end of a year, the most rigorous debaters are the ones for whom debate friends are their closest friends. Other people usually hangout with their own friends in the evening or on weekends, but these people have their debate friends at the forefront of their brain. 
- Some of these people are the ones who have shifted from their regular friend group, to having the soc as their primary friend group, due to various external factors. (PES changes sections, friends don't consistently meet, or people change their short break routine, but Debsoc sessions consistently happen so you constantly meet these people.) 
- Some of these people are the ones who were unable to form many friends at college to begin with. Either they didn't actively talk to people, they didn't have people who actively talked to them, or they didn't have much to talk about.
- - At debsoc, these people have seniors who actively talk to them. conversation feels natural since they've gotten used to speaking (for at least 7 minutes a day) and there is already content to discuss during post-debate relaxation.

This is perhaps the club's most beautiful legacy: for years, it has offered a community and friendship to members who yearn for it.

![enter image description here](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/908/925/7df.jpg)

Although I had other friends at college, none of them really matched up to the depth I found at Debsoc.

## Miscellaneous

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Teaching debate
For the love of God, there are better motions than THW legalize weed to use as an example when teaching debate. 
When asked to pick a random motion to demonstrate a concept, this has become the first motion that comes to mind. (Please have more relevant motions at hand before you start a matter session, it makes a huge difference in the illustration clarity of the lesson.)
- Since most freshers don't know about the system of the black market, or the mindset of druggies, a drug debate can feel disconnected.
- So when you teach mech and impacting, it doesn't feel as real. If you used a parenting motion, children could easily understand mech and impacting when they relate to it.
- Mechanizing "banning drugs makes people do drugs more" sounds quite implausible to the average fresher. (Even if you take a smaller burden and then try to combine a lot of different arguments to outweigh, it's hard to convincingly outweigh in the minds of freshers who assign so much negative weight to drugs in their head.)
- Flipping is way easier to understand in a motion like parenting. There are way more tangible examples here, like, "Constant reminders to study make you less studious instead of more."

The counter arguments I've heard about this are:
- It's short and sweet, that's why it comes to mind easily.
- It's more enticing and an "oooooo" topic.
- It's cool to blow people's minds when you make a gov case, cuz they're used to dissing on weed.
- It's a cool demonstration of a flip, saying that banning it makes it worse. 
- "If the first motion I encounter in the soc is something dry like parents and education I might leave"

which are fair, so decide what you feel.

---

When only one person shows up to a session and if you don't feel like cancelling the session and sending them away, this is a great time to teach debate (if you have the time and bandwidth).
What's great about this scenario is that you can make the lesson personalized, understand their thinking process, and then tune them precisely. From what I've seen, this has the most direct impact on their approach to debates as a whole, more than just giving them advice post a debate.
To you, it's low stakes practice of conducting a matter session. (It can really help to see what the mindset of a listener would be, when you are understandable, and when you aren't.)
I wouldn't worry about this personalized coaching being unfair, because the person you're teaching is the one that showed up on a day that no one else did. It helped me give people the individual attention that I've talked about in earlier chapters, one student at a time.

What I would do is make up a tangible motion they would understand, like, "This House Would Change PES timings," or, "THW put effort to get a girlfriend," and then ask questions to push them in a certain direction. Some other times, I would initially start some random conversation with them about their interests, find out something like them being a volunteer at Aatmatrisha, and then make up a specific motion like, "THW be a volunteer at Aatmatrisha".
Sometimes after this thorough discussion of their case, I got them to give a speech for them to see the effects of the deep prep on their confidence and speech quality (It felt really fulfilling for me to watch this as well).

Matter sessions are the most efficient when it comes to teaching, because you can reach the most people even if you can't attain depth with every student.

---

Narrative motions are notoriously tricky for debaters to wrap their head around. Everyone gets carried away believing that they should prove the narrative right or wrong, rather than proving the effects of the narrative to be beneficial or harmful. 

In most narrative motions, it's also extremely difficult to distinguish between the two, because people have such strong biases. 
For example, in "This house regrets the narrative that going to a prestigious university is the key to success", people will definitely end up arguing about whether it is possible to succeed without a university (proving it right or wrong). It's hard to differentiate this argument from a belief-focused argument. In the heads of juniors, people who go to prestigious universities believe in the narrative, and people who don't, don't believe in the narrative. (They may not think of people who believe in it but don't get to go.)
Even if you try to explain the difference in your OA/feedback, they may struggle to understand what you mean by the difference.


One beautiful narrative motion I came across recently (which I think doesn't suffer from this confusion), is:
This house regrets the dominant portrayal of long-distance relationships as doomed to fail.

Here, it's quite easy to explain that although the narrative could be right or wrong, this doesn't matter. It's also quite evident that people who believe the narrative, are going to give up on what could have been a successful relationship. How narratives can affect hope, which affects actions, is something that can clearly be mechanized from this motion. 

On a similar note, weighing is a tricky concept to talk about. What I found to be the most understandable way to explain it, was to talk about the trolley problem. Would you rather kill 2 old people or 1 young person? Would you rather kill 20 cats or 1 human? Would you rather cut off education from 10 people or medical treatment from 20 people? Whatever explanation juniors give for this is literally weighing.

### Pranks

My rule of thumb was to not play pranks, at least in the initial days, because it erodes trust in the club and its seniors. I abhor pranks like, "You won't get into debsoc," during recruitment time. I didn't want recruits to associate a feeling of anxiety with the debsoc. Freshers who have only confusion when it comes to PES and how things work at PES, are more intimidated than one would expect. You may think they know for sure that they're getting in, but freshers without a grip on how things work are still quite paranoid.
Light fun might ruin the experience of a few people. But if you can get people smiling and laughing out of it, convert it into lore, or talk about how you went through the same thing (like the prank of making people wear formals at their first tournament), then it can be beneficial.
The main use of the old WhatsApp groups of seniors, has now become organizing pranks on the juniors lmao.


---
### The damn PES timetable

There are different types of differences in the timetables. 
1. The difference of the daily timing for B. Tech and non B.Tech. This is so annoying because if one branch has a majority of people, the minority either end up too late for session prep time, or too early (they just leave for home). This causes many among the minority branch to quit debating. 
<br>
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/Fqdq4S84/Screenshot-2025-09-06-164009.png)
<br>
And the worst part is that the only way I see to solve this is to have enough seniors from the minority branch (which won't be the case if many of the minority have quit debating the year before), so this is a perpetuating cycle. (Luckily we presently do have core members and club heads from this minority, so hopefully sessions for the minority will continue to be arranged.)
Allowing people to join sessions late does mitigate this, but this is really hard to pull off efficiently and I don't know how to even go about it. You can't always make the latecomers adj. (Refer to the section where I spoke about [making latecomers adj](#common-pitfalls).)
<br>
Okay I just learned today that Law is a category of its own, which follows the 8 am to 4 pm timetable every semester, and hence it defects between the minority and majority.

2. The weekly timing which gives different people different combinations of half days. This further segregates the available recruits into different days. What we usually do is take a poll at the start of the semester asking for people to announce their half days, and then choose like 3 days out of these to hold debates weekly. This calculation involves somehow balancing 'maximization of people' along with, 'making sure every recruit has at least one day a week they can debate.'
The benefit of having a fixed 3 days per week is that it allows people to assimilate debsoc into their routine, which leads to the benefits mentioned earlier.

3. The alternate exam timing. A significant portion of the semester is consumed by exams, and different branches have them on different weeks (seniors usually have different dates from juniors). Since all seniors are usually occupied together, juniors have no one to conduct any debate activity that week. When juniors have exams, the available seniors now sit idle. This is often severely overlooked in plan making. If you want to conduct an event like a matter session or a Cubbon session, try to conduct it as soon as possible, even if not all factors seem favorable to you. I'd advise against holding out hope for a better opportunity, as the chances of one appearing are often slimmer than they seem. The window of opportunity is very limited and precious.
~~At least thank god you're not living in 2022-2023 where everyone had 5 ISAs, one ISA every 3 weeks, 2 different weeks for seniors and juniors, so there were only 5 weeks in a sem to debate.~~

We've thought about directing juniors to conduct sessions for themselves. The stance my seniors took in 2022 was to wait 6 months before allowing freshers to debate among themselves. This was because as freshers we weren't qualified enough and we could end up developing poor habits without a senior to correct us. I actually agree, and I think 6 months is a good place to draw the line.

---
### WhatsApp
Allowing them to text whatever they want, and making them feel comfortable, is a great way to get juniors to bond together, get connected to the community, and engage more with the club. (Equity rules can still apply, and that's up to the equity community.)
However, this spam of texts unrelated to debate causes quite a few people to mute the group. 
The issue of people reaching the point where they mute the group, is that they now miss out on the occasional important message. 
Our solution to appease both the yappers and the muters, was to create a new group for Sessions (and utilize the Announcements channel on the Community). 
The polls for every session were posted on this group, and these polls included the options of 2 pm, 4 pm, and No. Texting permission in Sessions was given to admins only, and the admins were all the seniors who had expressed interest in conducting sessions. The polls needed to be posted a day in advance so that people could plan well.
The Announcements channel was for important announcements and major documents like the manual which needed to be accessible. The messages here needed to be minimized so that people could search up quickly. 

My advice would be to share the motion on the non Sessions group so that people can randomly discuss the motion by replying to it (because it takes more effort for people to switch groups to talk about a motion, than to just reply to a message above). The only people who would be able to reply to it if sent on Sessions, are other seniors with texting permissions, and them doing this leads to spam.

In my opinion, even all queries and answers to queries about the session should be on Shenanigans to minimize spam in Sessions. People have different tipping points when it comes to muting, and we don't want people to mute the Sessions group (even if they are on the fence about even engaging). 
Spam by seniors happens often due to accidents, and as long as you realize, cut it out, and redirect it to shenanigans quickly, you won't reach anyone's muting tipping points.


PES clubs often tell juniors to market events on every group they are a part of.
The default stance assumed by juniors is that you can send anything you want (especially once the group transitions into random spam). Pre-2023, the Debsoc group was for formal messages only. In 2024, everything was allowed, except for marketing posts from other clubs. This was rather odd, because what makes us find some spam okay but other spam as spam? 
(The cause of this decision was the Debsoc getting pissed by MUN marketing one day, but we couldn't announce that we were banning mun posts, so we said we were banning all posts). 

I think this was rather dumb, 
- especially since the we later need to do marketing in other groups ourselves. It makes us look hypocritical and shitty when the Debsoc markets itself in a Write Angle group but doesn't allow Write Angle events to be marketed in the Debsoc group (which affects the marketing itself, obviously).
- We should be able to tolerate MUN marketing. Most people who have been recruited into Debsoc are loyal enough to not leave anyway. A little bit of MUN marketing won't convince them, and we shouldn't display our fragile egos by saying, "Don't join, MUN is trash".
- If someone is actually destined for MUNsoc, then it's evil of us to prevent MUNsoc marketing from reaching them for the sake of keeping them in our club. We are then basically the witch who keeps Rapunzel locked in a tower to prevent her from leaving and following her destiny, just so that we can extract more value out of her and her hair.

####  More on our approach to MUN as a whole

Since quite a few people try out both clubs, it's unwise to alienate MUN people. 

![image](https://i.ibb.co/rfNNY5sw/debsocmunsoc.png)

Across the year, a few people do switch from debsoc to munsoc, and munsoc to debsoc. This happens naturally and you don't have much power to prevent this by directly targeting MUN. There's no guarantee that your effort will bear fruit instead of backfiring.
It's more dignified to just take the high road. As mentioned earlier, any insults at MUN are unlikely to be persuasive to anyone who's interested in MUN. 

There's no real benefit, but harm still does arise of this action. Even people who never even cared about MUN, will still see the debsoc spewing hate, and think worse of the debsoc. I myself would lose respect for a debsoc member who needed to hate on MUN to make debate look valuable (already happened this last year).

## The Glorious Unicorn

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The ultimate stage, the final form of a junior, isn't when they pass a certain skill level. It's an identity shift.
**It's when they see themselves as a debater.**

They believe, "Debsoc is my club." They know, "Debating is what I _do_." Their friends think, "Debating is all they do."

Seeing debate as central to their identity means that they will forever exhibit soc loyalty. They've reached the point of no return. They will come to sessions because that is what they were meant to do. They were born to pursue this activity.

When you see signs of this in a junior, you know you've done it. It's the greatest success. Regardless of their skill level, if they've reached this mindset, then you've truly transformed their life.

It's not easy or quick. For 2 years I hadn’t felt like a true debater. In my head, my seniors were the ones who were debaters, and I wasn't in their vicinity.

But to my surprise, I see signs of this in a few first years now. I see them talking about the club in such a possessive way. I see Debsoc being such a natural part of their weekly routine. They talk about their future in the debsoc without uncertainty. It's lovely.

When something is a part of your identity, you no longer feel like you're making an effort to change yourself, because this already is your natural state.

Everything the soc does is in hopes of leading juniors up to this stage. And it feels truly wonderful when it manifests and you spot this beautiful unicorn.

![enter image description here](https://wallpaperaccess.com/download/beautiful-unicorn-732536)

I hope everything so far has been able to empower you with ideas and the vision to tackle challenges that arise.

Carrying out any of this is easier said than done. Every bit of it takes Herculean effort, and not all effort even translates into success. But you are Hercules. You are my heroes.



> If you reached all the way here, I admire your effort and commitment to the Debsoc. The determination and the attention span you possess to read my ginormous Yap.  
> Thank you for giving me a voice.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to 

Nikhil, an ex-club head, who had the vision behind many of these systems, framed words in a way that accurately described the way I felt about many topics, and supported me throughout my journeys of both debate and writing this.

Stuthi, an ex-club head, who proofread this book and gave me the very contributions I was missing.

Nahush, who peeked at Stuthi's phone while she was proofreading it, searched up the site at home, read the whole book, and showed me that there's someone out there who would read all my word vomit. Without Nahush I would never have the determination to go on and complete this book.

Samuel, another ex-club head, my mentor, the senior who I always looked up to, the soul who made scattered members converge around him like a campfire, my main source of Debsoc lore, and a man with whom I have discussed Debsoc systems extensively.

Everyone, my seniors, my batchmates, my juniors, who I've met along the journey and gave me insight into how things work in the debate world.

And you, dear reader, for believing in the weight of my words enough to read this.

_I also credit Google Gemini for informing me when my sentences didn't have the tone I intended, and also for giving me appropriate replacements for words and phrases when I asked for them._
