# This House Would...

Welcome, valued Debsoc core member.

The purpose of this document is to pass on knowledge, to prevent future batches from repeating mistakes, and to make tried-and-tested solutions repeatable.
As seniors, it's our responsibility to make you, our juniors, not feel lost about running the club. This document is extensive because I want to make you aware of every incident that can pop up during recruitments and debate sessions.

A lot of these solutions may seem like common knowledge, but I believe it's important that these are pondered and have motivated effort behind their implementation.

- As every coder knows, replacing an existing solution with a different solution can lead to other problems popping up.
- So, every solution I talk about will have reasoning, what it's meant to solve, and its flaws that still persist. As long as you're aware of these reasons, you will be better informed in which system to choose, and will make thoughtful changes.
- I believe that every batch will be able to improve upon existing systems.[^1] The ideal is for every change to be a step forward, instead of causing old problems to resurface.
- An ideal change would patch up existing flaws without opening up the flaws covered by old systems. However, trade-offs must be made sometimes, and I trust you to weigh which flaws are worth handling.

[^1]: As of now this will probably be through people making comments on the Dropbox link of this document. I'm unsure how I'll fit their comment onto the Blogger document and credit their name next to their paragraph. I may even shift to github pull requests and possibly eventually pass control on.

**So who am I, and why care about what's written here?**
~~It feels cringe to type this~~
I'm Srijan Badhya, a member of Debate Shenanigans 3.0 (if you still follow that chronological system). I've been a part of around 200 debates with PES Debsoc members across my 4 years. I've helped conduct recruitments for 3 batches, and experienced the recruitment for my own batch. I have experienced being under different leaders, and have experience trying different forms of leadership myself. I've engaged with dozens of juniors about how they feel in the soc. I've talked to debaters from other colleges about how they believe societies should be run. There are too many people to credit in the making of this book, in fact, they're everyone I've had the honor of meeting across my debate career. 
You can contact me at srijanbadhya@gmail.com or artemisrijan@gmail.com, I'll definitely reply within a week. 

There already exists a globally famous document, [How to Start a Debate Society](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAni64_JD4Uu6N00kryFs0j_W7q1Heeb/view). I thought that it was necessary to have something more tailored to PES, tailored to the state of the PES Debsoc at the moment, and hence I embarked on this project.

<br>
<br>

This document is long. I don't want to make you give up the way I gave up halfway through Hadar's matter session on closing (I'm sorry Hadar), ==so this will be the format of the content:==
In true debate fashion, this book will have my claims about what I think a good action to follow is, and what to keep in mind for decisions. 
- If you believe in the claim and decide to implement it, you can skip the reasons and move on. **(try to skip as many bullet points as you can so that you don't lose the will to read this document)**
- If you disagree instead, I implore you to read the reasoning behind the claim. If you're able to take down these reasons with a better claim, a better system, or outweigh them, then you should go ahead with this better claim. 

It does take effort to keep these policies implemented, and I want to be able to convince you that it is worth the effort to implement something instead of believing, "What happens naturally is enough".
I don't want mistakes from the past to repeat because I wasn't able to empower my juniors with functional systems.
I believe it's good to keep in mind the merits and demerits of alternate policies while implementing a particular policy.


The claims will be in **bold** and the reasons will be in bullet points. Alternate systems conceptualized or once followed will be in _italics_. 

**My whole yap isn't to say, "This is what you _should_ follow", but rather to just explain the frontier of my knowledge and lay out my case, hoping that you can overcome limitations, expand the frontier, and make better systems.**

Before we get to the policies, let me first talk about the guiding values which are the basis for all the claims here (what we prioritized in our decisions).

# Guiding Principles

## The Point of a Debate Club
2 parts: Debate, and Club

_There are people who say that the point of a debate club is to debate, and it's bad to chill too much_
I believe chilling is fine, in so far as it assists in the direction of the purpose of the club. (there I said it, the first and last time I'll use that debate phrase!!)

The single biggest purpose of a club is to ==provide value to every single member.==


Why do people want to join a club?

- They believe the activity will be enjoyable.
- They believe they'll learn something from the activity.
- They believe they'll be able to hang out with nice fun people.

I will henceforth link all my arguments to these impacts of joy, growth, and community.
I believe a club should not stray away from meeting these 3 needs of its members. 
The needs are heavily disagreed upon, and the methods even more so. 



_**Some have believed that the point of the debate club is to win tournaments and get accolades.**_

- _This does initially make sense since our tournament results are what our PES management gets to see._
- _And the debsoc cares about getting funded by PES because that's how we get to go to more fun tournaments._

**However, some of us believe that if you judge the club solely by its tournament wins, you may lose sight of what matters, and a number of unhealthy behaviors can creep in.**

- To win tournaments, you might start prioritizing your attention towards the people who already show potential and debate skills, to hone them further.
- This could also mean that when you have limited tournament slots or resources, you give them to the people already performing well.
- **A hierarchy forms where people feel like worthless members when they're not the ones bringing in the accolades.**
- - They take tournament losses even more seriously because they're now a disappointment to the soc, not someone the soc is proud to have.
- When a good debater becomes problematic, you're willing to let it slide because they're 'valuable to the soc'.
  + They may continue ruining the debate club experience for everyone else, while still bringing in tournament wins.
  + By utilitarian metrics, this reduces the number of people who enjoy debate and the club, reduces their enjoyment of debate and the club, and hence reduces the breadth and depth of the value given by the club.
- You might get depressed over the Debsoc 'deteriorating' when the people are actually doing fine. They're still enjoying the club and enjoying debate but you're hyperventilating.
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/fd1BYB3t/Whats-App-Image-2025-09-09-at-23-33-50.jpg)
- You might be cringe and hesitate to work with other societies and give good feedback because they're 'rival societies' who are 'taking away your wins'. (For a while I had to process these cringe thoughts in my own head).

**Most of the benefits are accessible even when you don't solely care about tournament wins. You can still achieve joy, growth, and community without grinding solely for tournament wins.**

- In the 2020-2023 timeframe, the PES management still freely provided reimbursement for tourneys, regardless of the lack of breaks we had in quite a few tourneys. **PES seems to fund us to support activity in the club, more than 'bringing PES name and fame', which they enjoy as a side effect, not as the main purpose.**
- A bit of extra seriousness might lead to better 'results', but this can significantly take away from joy and the community, so be careful what extent you're doing it to.
  + **Debating should not feel like studying. People shouldn't feel guilty for not putting in the work. People shouldn't be so turned off by the concept of having to output results that they stop enjoying the activity itself.**

_Some people believe that even having 3 members is enough as long as they're constantly debating and grinding. (The debsoc did reach this point in 2020 I believe.)_
Some of us (including me) believe that being more chill and having more people for fun, is worth it, even if it slows our improvement in debating. 

- A big reason people engage with the debate club is for community, for their friends, for fun with them, so I believe that having enjoyable chill time goes a long way in getting people to stay, and also motivates them to debate more. 
- So this isn't as mutually exclusive as it seems. I believe that sacrificing chillness for grinding is worse than sacrificing grinding for chillness, because the chillness and fun motivates people to come to debates and grow anyway. 
- I don't think you should worry about being too chill and lenient, because being hardcore and strict tends to cause a worse effect in debaters ([but more on that later](#push-to-come-to-sessions)).

<br>



## Metrics
So if not tournament wins, what metric _do_ you judge the club by?
I personally say don't judge the club at all. 

- In theory, metrics are useful to judge a club to see whether the systemic change you implemented had any positive effect or not.
- However, unfortunately, Debsoc is not like a machine learning model where you can instantly see the result of one tweak. You usually can't even clearly pinpoint the cause of a change in the state of the soc that you see. A million different factors affect everything, and the only way to retrospectively decide whether a change was good or bad, is if you can somehow derive that the change directly caused certain impacts.
- Sure, you can ask people how they felt about a certain change, and take this feeling as a metric. The priority is the happiness of the members, more than any results.

_Common metrics people often take are tournament wins, number of active members, or number of active members in sessions, etc._
- Unfortunately, even the result from such a metric can be misleading. Just because you have less members this year doesn't mean you were shit at running the club. There are more factors out of your control than you can imagine.
- 'How skilled juniors are' shouldn't be the metric of whether you are a good mentor, because everyone has different starting points. It's about whether they're getting better. It's about whether they feel happy in this club.

Sure, there aren't any provable 'harms' of using inaccurate metrics, except for the long-term culture of the club where juniors feel themselves being pushed towards results instead of enjoying the process.
(Like me being proud of studying more this month than last month, before having my spirits crushed by my father who informs me that my score has dipped. ~~He doesn't know that this chapter was way harder than the last chapter,~~ so I feel unfairly judged, because my knowledge and work ethic have actually grown).

If you do _have_ to take metrics, try to somehow link them to the joy, growth, and interpersonal well-being of the members.

# Inside a session
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

## Session Concepts
Many factors go into ensuring the quality of experience of a debate session.

Debate is an extreme sport, and half the people are inevitably going to feel sad at the end of a session.
![The Judge Every Session](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/535/089/5e9.jpg)
 Sadness cannot be avoided, but we can absolutely work to minimize its sting.
 
Debate is weird and often an acquired taste. I believe that it takes quite a while to get a feel for debate before you fall in love with the real thing, rather than what you thought it would be. So, hooking in people to come for the initial sessions in the short term, is crucial to push them towards the love point. (This love point is usually the point where your brain gains 'debate vision', and you start to understand what goes on in a debate.)
For this purpose, I think it's justified to paint an incomplete picture of debate and slowly nurture people before you hit them with the brutality of it.

What I mean by this is:
- Not dropping finance and IR (International Relations) motions in the early days.
- Even within other subjects, giving easy and accessible motions (and motions they would find fun). Feeling hopeless and having nothing to say before a speech is quite depressing. 
- Although we know that nearly all motions are balanced, freshers often think most motions are unbalanced. Give them easy motions which even they will think are balanced.
- Philosophy motions are usually fun, but unfortunately usually follow the format of, "THW use this amazing technology", and feel unbalanced for opp because:
- + Freshers feel lost thinking of an opp case because the benefits look great and they don't know how to outweigh them.
- + Beginners don't think about regulation, mismanagement, and long term consequences.
- + So even if there is tremendous learning potential after the round, people can feel depressed during the round.
- + (If you can give hints of the case lines, like regulation, to both sides, then you can still make it work.)
- Not being brutally honest in the early days and telling speakers their speeches were shit.
- Spending extra time and effort in the early days compared to later days, providing aftercare to the wounded recruits.
- Being generous with prep time so that they build their confidence and lessen their anxiety. We don't need to make them tournament-ready until later.
- I found it helpful to **have a short speech before every debate saying that verdict doesn't matter, growth happens regardless, and what matters is that they enjoy it.** Because even if this is common knowledge, I believe this needs to be drilled into the heads of freshers so that they are in the right headspace every debate. I did this throughout round 3, but I think post round 3 it probably isn't really required because they're used to it.

If you're reading this, you would have already faced the grueling learning curve of being humbled over and over. I believe that if the extremely challenging parts of the learning curve are exposed to people too early, they wouldn't have the love-fueled commitment to persevere through the hardship.
- I know this may look like treating juniors like snowflakes. Even so, debating does get sad, some friends and I still get sad on the regular. Having someone show empathy to you can mean the world to you.
- + _Sure, the argument against this is that if you keep protecting them, they'll never be able to stand on their own two feet._
- But I disagree, regardless of how much their wounds are bandaged by you, recurring wounds make them stronger naturally with time.
- + _The other argument is to just follow natural selection so that you quickly end up with the debaters who had the most mettle to begin with. But I believe people can grow mettle over time (with your nurturing), and you're leaving these people out if you just let them end themselves._
- + From personal experience, I and a few other people would have quit debating early if we felt like we were inherently too dumb for this shit. So try to effectively balance humbling, learning, and happiness, to keep them coming until they're ready to face hard mode. 
![enter image description here](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/944/435/931.jpg)
- Keeping it challenging yet making people feel like they were able to contribute something significant is key.
- Even the easiest motions are challenging to recruits due to various reasons like not reaching 7 minutes. This translates to already a high amount of learning. Any benefit by doubling difficulty is marginal.

![image](https://i.ibb.co/tPCYNSgR/sadaboutdebate1.png)
![image](https://i.ibb.co/dw3rpnpr/sadaboutdebate2.png)
- I've come to believe that **love for debate can't really be tested from day one.**

## Time
[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

From the feedback forms and personal experience, the single biggest deterrent of attending debate sessions is time. 
![idle time](https://i.ibb.co/F47qvtxK/idle-time.png)

Having to **sit idle** before a debate starts significantly impacts the quality of experience of the session for a junior. The delay stretches in their head and contributes to a belief of debate being a waste of time. 
Multiple delays in each process add up to juniors starting late and going home late.
- Often in 2023, juniors would show up to sessions before seniors and then ask on Whatsapp where the seniors were. It was extremely optically bad for seniors to look 'unserious' and uncaring of juniors and debate.
- Making 1 person wait for 5 more people to show up before starting AP prep is a massive delay for the first person, even if they consent when asked, "Are you okay waiting a bit for 5 people?"
- In 2023, after juniors had shown up, the seniors would still take quite some time to choose a suitable motion for juniors. A lot of time was taken to filter a motion because they also needed to not give juniors motions which they didn't understand. 
![enter image description here](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/003/105/514/a81.jpg)

The obvious solutions to this are:
1. Do whatever it takes to show up as early as possible or have someone there to get things going.
2. **To start prep time even when you have only 2 or 3 people, even if you expect more people to come. This is okay because**
 + You can't always rely on the people who voted to arrive, and this could result in waiting unnecessarily for nobody.
+ Having extra prep time isn't much of a harm, at least people don't feel like they're sitting idle since they're doing all they can to come up with a case.
+ You can inform the juniors that they will be ironing, and can replace iron slots with other people if they show up.
 + People who come early deserve to get the extra prep time, maybe this will incentivize latecomers to also put extra effort.
 ![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/vxmXxr6y/Screenshot-2025-09-06-164214.png)
 (I know the responses say that the current system is perfect, but I think there's no big harm to start even earlier and cut the idle time of the 3 people who have already shown up). 
 
 + Prep time isn't as valuable to whips anyway, since their content majorly depends on what is said during the debate. People who come just before the debate is supposed to start, can be whips if slots are open.
 + You can choose to either shorten the total prep time, or have the initial prep time as a bonus, depending on how late it's already gotten.
 + Making latecomers adj can be problematic to how adjing is treated and the narrative that propagates. [Be careful about the narrative you build around adjudication](#the-adj-narrative)
3. Something I'm guilty of myself is taking too much time to prepare my OA.
![image](https://i.ibb.co/5xkDMz4s/Screenshot-2025-09-06-163856.png)
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/1fXTyKf8/Screenshot-2025-09-09-135934.png)
4. **Have a list of motions made in your free time before the session, so that you're not wasting session time.**

Here are the motions I used in 2024-2025.
[Motion list](#motion-list)
 They were curated to fit the motion criteria talked about earlier this chapter. I have cut out around 30 motions I had initially thought were good, yet ended up leading to messy debates, showing they were bad motions.
So all the motions left here are ones whose debates ended up being decent enough to pass my test.

Feel free to reuse these motions or compile new ones.

I had prioritized parenting, education, and romance motions, but the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059) shows that people soon got bored of these motions and wanted different ones too.
![From the Google Form](https://i.ibb.co/fd1q7Tyk/motionpref.png)
- There are also oddballs who want finance and IR motions, and these people usually get sidelined in the interest of keeping the motions debatable for everyone.
You can consider occasionally catering to these people (I should have).

![image](https://i.ibb.co/z1sLVdt/Screenshot-2025-09-06-162422.png)


Since debates usually involve 6-8 freshers and 1 senior, what naturally happens is that the senior methodically conducts the debate, then the debate ends and people go home. This is the default state that seniors have too.
- Debate feels like a college class where you're one random person lost among the masses.
- If I had to pick the one principle I found the most important to keep in mind, it would be to **give individual attention to every participant**. 
- Not everyone approaches you themselves to ask for personal feedback, so you need to find a way to have one on one interactions with everyone.
- Make people feel valued, make people feel that they made a difference by being there. Because very often people do feel left out and feel like they don't belong.
- Everyone belongs, so make sure they do feel that they belong.
- The one-on-one interaction could be about anything, doesn't have to be about feedback on their speech, just whatever they feel about everything.
- Having ties to the community is what really fosters loyalty and makes people excited to come to the Debsoc.


You will be quite busy as an organizer and a judge, and when OA preparation time consumes you, it's hard to give people individual attention.
**At that moment, it can be crucial to tell at least people, to cross over, shake hands, and chill.** 
- It's detrimental if people are sitting in their own seats scrolling their phones during your OA prep time. 
- When people cross over, conversation on the debate usually gets going. There are unresponded POIs and other thoughts on the debate that people are often bursting to say.
- This initial conversation gets the community vibe started, and freshers usually carry the conversation themselves after that.
- It's very important to give the initial push for them to cross over after the debate if they don't cross over themselves.

##  Feedback

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Feedback is often tricky once your brain has shut down after the debate. Often you'll just try to make up something from your own notes.
One thing I found useful was to write down my feedback as the speeches were happening. The moment a question came to my mind during the speech like, "Missing reasoning", I wrote it down in brackets. It helped me deliver the feedback quicker when I was asked for it.

Ideally the judges who conduct sessions are ones who've read and understood the manual, so that 
- Their feedback is far more likely to be valid.
- Reading the manual also gives the judge conviction behind their feedback because they know it to be correct, rather than saying, "I'm not sure about this but I don't think you're allowed to edit your model in the second speech, still not sure though".
- Wrong feedback can set debaters back quite a bit and it's hard for them to ever realize that this is wrong later. They are likely to approach future debates believing this is right, and also ignore tourney adjes who contradict this feedback because "these tourney adjes don't know what they're talking about". 

The impulsive way to give feedback is telling people how they messed up and what they can improve on.
But I think **consciously trying to tell people what they got right** as well is incredibly impactful for a few reasons:

- Freshers often do random genius stuff they weren't taught to do, like weighing sometimes. Give them a signal that this is something good which they should keep going. 
- If juniors just change their approach constantly, they won't really know what to keep.
- Just like tournaments, speakers feel understood and cared for when their ideas were received by the judge. The more positive emotions people associate with the debsoc, the more they'll want to keep coming.
- From the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKTWmg4VqlNQVXDcwTQ2-JSK5x-3oWyVtDS4VwnxN1Qpoytw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=115888508141230211059), something juniors feel is, "I'm working hard in debate everyday but get the same brutal feedback all the time, am I just unable to grow at all? Is there any point to this?"
![image](https://i.ibb.co/27VvCzRf/feedback-reaction.png)
- They're already getting humbled by other factors, we don't want them to get humbled to the point where they quit.
- "You got so far doing this right, you just need to tweak the last bit of delivery" is quite motivational for someone to hear, balancing happiness and motivation to grow.

(I personally didn't follow this as well as I should have, and consciously gave positive advice only a small portion of the time. I should have done it more, I was just too much in the zone of 'constructive criticism'.)

A great way to give feedback to debaters, is to **ask them questions about their case** like, "Why do you think this is true?", and once they answer, say, "This is good reasoning which should have come out in your speech". 
This solves 2 problems. 
1. If you gave regular feedback, it might feel wrong to them (like they disagree with you, but they won't push you more on it)
2. Your feedback won't feel obvious to them like, "speak your sentence clearer".
3. More importantly, it makes them feel good about themselves since it came out of their own mouth, and makes them realize it isn't an inherent IQ issue but actually a presentation issue.

You'll have to decide your own policy on speaker scores. I, for one,  believed speaker scores shouldn't be given in mock for a few reasons:

- Speaker scores are such a scam, different judges give different speaker scores, and brackets are also unclear and judges may not know, "how relevant is 'frequently relevant',".
- At least with feedback you can give everyone feedback and criticize them all. With public speaker scores, there's an 'objective' hierarchy of who is the worst debater in the room, the second worst etc. (at least in the eyes of an average fresher).
- There's no real benefit of 'extra motivation to grind' when you give people speaker scores.
- When they've already had a bad day, shit speaks can further mess them up. 
- The argument against this is, "omg they won't know how speaker scores work in real tournaments then", but the harms outweigh the benefits. It's not really important to know how speakers scores work at tournaments unless you're a judge.
- Another argument is that people can track their progress, but speaker scores are quite stagnant since the realistic range is so small. This can give the illusion of a lack of progress.


## Balancing

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Once you know the skill levels of people, you can occasionally match up teammates to make the debate 'balanced'.
- Losing debates nonstop will get to anyone. Even the 'weakest' debater is a valuable member of the soc, and their self-esteem needs to be kept high enough to be motivated to come to sessions. Even if they feel trash, they shouldn't further feel like utter trash. (In fact a weak debater is a vulnerable stakeholder, and if you're not able to uplift those who work hard, then it's a skill issue of the Debsoc).
- I found that stealthily teaming them up with debaters I thought were good, kept the debates close and exciting too.
- This also gave all debaters experience in working with different kinds of people.


## Keeping it fun

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Debate can get boring fast until you've stayed long enough to acquire the taste. 
Don't be afraid to sprinkle in stuff like Harry Potter motions, PES related motions (carefully), the sugar daddy motion (Motion 39 over [here](#motion-list)).
- This leads to more fun, laughter, and people feeling that the soc is a place they can have a great time in.
- Being informal and saying weird stuff makes people get more open and comfortable with each other.

There isn't much 'risk'.
- People won't straight up complain to the PES management about this. 
- It can't possibly be sensational enough for a mass forward unless there's a video recording or something, and that's easily preventable.
- The worst that could happen is people joking about it with their friends from out of debsoc, and that's just free marketing.
- Through many debates people already know that the debsoc usually debates serious topics, so this won't make the entire soc look unserious.
- Even if the motion ends up in the hands of PES management, they wouldn't care enough to give serious consequences. Our usual feminism motions about sex positivity and regretting the stigmatization of hookup culture are riskier.

#### Turncoat
When there have been 2 or 3 people showing up for a session (like it often happens in odd sems before recruitments), we have played Turncoat with each other. A prompt is given, a person speaks, and every time the prompter claps their hands, the speaker has to switch sides. Sometimes we have fun prompts too like someone's feelings about her microbiology professor, and Bharath's experience conducting PESDT.
It is still well aligned in the direction of sharpening your debate skills, and is super fun because of how quick witted you have to be when changing.

#### Alley Debating
I spoke to a few debate prodigies from Aditi Mallya (the two girls who were runners up at PESDT in 2024), and they told me about Alley debating. We've implemented it twice in debsoc sessions.
The way it works is that everyone goes to the podium and stands in 2 lines of 3 people each. It works like an AP with no prep time, no POIs, and 1-minute speeches per person. We would pass the phone which held the timer like a baton from speaker to speaker. Every speech had to be some sort of an extension like BP.
It was fun cuz of how goofy it was, and very time efficient too.


#### Impromptu debates
Pretty straightforward. Especially good when there are like 2 people for a session. No prep time, the motion drops and the PM just starts yapping. (The LO technically gets 7 minutes prep time). For more participants, this format isn't as impactful because they don't feel the time crunch as much.
It's a good way to keep you on your feet and make you better prepared for tourney time crunches.

#### Pop debates
The way the Debsoc conducted recruitments for my batch in Jan 2022 was by enticing us with pop culture referencing motions. With AI, this has gotten even better to do because you can ask it to give you, "Naruto debate motions", and it actually cooks fun motions. 
The issue with this is that not all of the debaters would have watched Naruto, so these people don't share in the fun. 

Such fun motion days are best for when chatter in the Debsoc has progressed to the point where people know each other's likes and dislikes, and only a few people with common interests have shown up to the debate session. I did a 1v1 on a Maroon 5 motion versus Raj, and Raunak did a 1v1 on a How I Met Your Mother motion versus someone. ChatGPT is actually pretty good at generating motions for a niche interest which doesn't have motions made on it already (that's what we did for Maroon 5).

This variety of debate activities keeps debate fresh and fun.

#### Game Night
In early 2024, my batch of clubheads started online game nights. Popular games are the ones people have experience playing in class already, like Skribbl.io.

If you've successfully gotten everyone onto the PES discord (which is a feat of its own), then discord has a lot of inbuilt games in the 'activity' feature, like PuttParty, which we once played. It also makes it easier to get on Voice Chat alongside this, which adds to the fun.

### Online Sessions
At the beginning of his clubhead term, Nikhil and I walked around during breaks and asked random 2nd years about how they felt about clubs. A surprising number of them said that the factor keeping them away from clubs was accessibility, because they had to travel home and couldn't stay at PES. They wished there were more online activities by clubs.

While Nikhil and I understood this exclusive benefit, we're still certified haters of online sessions.
- The community aspect doesn't feel natural because someone has to initiate conversation during OA prep time (and the responsible senior is usually busy prepping their OA).
- Without being able to see each other, conversation quickly turns awkward.
- People talk over each other each other making everything more awkward.
- It's easy to become depressed post your debate because you're all alone (happens to me often).
- The impressions of people aren't that impactful.
- Conversation between the seniors and juniors often ends after the OA/feedback. You have to consciously initiate further conversation. However offline, conversation would happen naturally on the way to the gate.
- Nobody really leaves an impression, you can't often remember debating alongside someone if they were just a name on your screen.
- People either forget about the session, or join really late because there are so many things at home that can take up your time. Back in 2022, online sessions set for 9 pm used to start at 10 pm. 
- If someone starts off debating with online sessions, they might drop out because they're unaware that online sessions are far inferior to the fun of offline sessions.

However, since you can access a few people who are online-only, I'd recommend doing at least one online session a week for these people who don't wish to come offline. Preferably a Friday evening or Saturday evening. The Debsoc gravitates to the 9 pm time. Even when we tried to schedule these sessions earlier, we were shown that a majority of college students are available only at the 9, 9:30 pm time.
Even if they don't practice body language and the feeling of speaking to a physical audience which are useful for tournaments, they're still tournament-ready for online tournaments.

The closest I've ever been to quitting debate, was after an online debate. I gave a shit speech, left the call entirely, flopped onto my bed, and stared at the ceiling. 
It means the world to people if you dm them and check up on them and how they feel about the session. (easier if you weren't involved in the session). 

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/qL0ScSGB/right-before-crossmocks.jpg)

### Cross Mocks
Everyone goes on about how game-changing cross mocks are, and how they give you the tournament experience without needing to pay money for it. 
Here are some of my thoughts about the challenges, pros and cons of them.
1. The groups Mixidea and 4crossmock are more bloated than ever, and the dead outnumber the living. It's no longer like our days where access was easy either. Sure, other groups always pop up, but there are doubts about their consistency in activity.
2. Most cross mocks get cancelled due to the adj scarcity. Even if you do find an adj, they're unlikely to be of high quality (because only new judges are the ones willing to judge a random cross mock) and give you the, 'mind-blowing diverse genius new perspective ' feedback which you're looking for. (Both a lack of capacity since this is a noob judge, and a lack of incentive since you're not a part of their soc).
3. The whole argument of cross mocks is that regular mocks lead to inbreeding, where everyone's just following the same debate gene pool. Everyone is isolated and could be veering off what real debate is, and there's no one to correct them.
- I think this is slightly exaggerated, because
- - as long as people have access to the WUDC BP manual, you'll be mostly accurate enough. 
- - Even if you debate the same people over and over, it's rare for this to be the cause of improvement plateauing. There's so much you can improve even with the same people, like how well you characterize, mechanize, analyze, impact. Other people's debating _styles_ have less impact on your own skill improvement imo.
- - By the time you reach anything close to a plateau of debating the same people, new juniors will have appeared.
- - Even if you're clueless and just debate over and over, there is still things to be learned, public speaking to be improved, and fun to be had, which meets the 3 goals of the club.
4. Tournaments _do_ provide a lot of the benefits which crossmocks try to provide but fail to.
5. To be fair, speakers in cross mocks are usually more skilled than debaters at PES, so adjing a high quality cross mock or speaking in one (if you miraculously find an adj) can be beneficial to see how experts do it. 
- - This can still be gained by watching WUDC videos online, but to be fair there's more procrastination to watch a WUDC video than, "a spar at 9pm today".


University specific cross mocks are great at improving inter soc ties. A lot of societies do have the incentive, are very interested to do cross mocks with PES, but often lack the capacity.
I was the head of the NLS x PES cross mock initiative, and I saw that lot of issues of sessions are exacerbated in cross mocks.

1. If you thought syncing schedules between B. Tech students and non B.Tech students was challenging, try syncing with A WHOLE OTHER UNIVERSITY.
2. If you thought getting people to come to sessions was challenging, try getting people WHO DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU to vote and come.
3. If you thought the walk to the basement deters people, think about travel to a whole other campus.
4. Of course, cycling the adjes and taking turns is another challenge.

Sure, online sessions mitigate these issues to quite some extent, but they pretty much convert the university specific cross mock into a regular cross mock.

With NLS, I've held one online cross mock, 2 offline cross mocks at NLS, and one offline cross mock at PES (I adjed them all).

The first offline mock had a few interested NLS students and a few PES students. NLS people spend all day in the library, so to get enough debaters, my NLS friends had to beg their debsoc friends and drag them from the study zone of the library to the zone where we were debating.
Clearly such people couldn't be dragged all the way to PES if a mock happened there.

The second offline mock at NLS was when three friends called me since they wanted to practice for a tournament, and I brought two people from PES along.
These offline sessions had fun vibes because we did get the tourney excitement of being at a new campus, and facing new people.

For the offline session at PES, an NLS friend of mine dragged her friend to PES and we did a half BP. I was disappointed with the PES turnout because I had thought the debate being local would drive more people.

The other 4-5 times I tried to hold sessions with NLS, I got a lackluster response on the polls.

In summary, I think cross mocks are cool when they're successful. Making them successful is quite tedious. I don't think it's really a cause for concern if you're doing too few cross mocks, because there are plenty of other ways to access their benefits. And even if you inbreed, it can't be _that_ bad. (Okay I'll stop using that word).

## A few issues of sessions that persist

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

a) Dividing the workload:

Every year we try hard to encourage people to come, and people do 'commit' in theory. 
But it always looks like people lack the push to actually show up.
We have had seniors take up voluntary adjing slots using an excel sheet before, but people would often forget, or not feel obligated enough to write their name themselves.

I don't know if this is due to the bystander effect caused by there always being someone already conducting the session. 
But even if there already is someone, **more seniors are always needed.**
- The person who 'conducts' the session usually ends up judging, which can tire them out. Taking over their judging shifts and letting them speak gives them a chance to refresh.
- My conversation with Akshat Saxena taught me that pro-ams are one of the most crucial ways to fast-track debate progress. Because matter sessions aren't enough if both participants don't actively work on the same case together. Pro-ams help juniors understand what the right debate habits are. 
- Case prep with a senior you've teamed up with by itself is an incredible learning experience, and a very cool fascinating experience for the juniors that I've spoken to.
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/CsvVJk5s/Screenshot-2025-09-06-170630.png)
- Having too many seniors is always better than having too few seniors. In the worst case if you have a debate room full of juniors, and 2 extra seniors, these seniors can always at least guide the case prep of the juniors and cheer them on, even if they don't speak themselves.


 
Senior judge: junior participant ratio is a big deal. Often the debsoc doesn't even have 1 available senior for 6 juniors. Early on there are often too many juniors. One way to combat this is having more seniors. Another way is spreading out sessions even more (scheduling sessions according to the availability of the seniors rather than juniors), such that the juniors are spread out across different sessions, but the senior is available to repeat sessions.

When more than a room full of juniors pull up, there are a few ways to adjust it.
You can make the extra person adj a handful of times, but make sure they don't feel like they didn't matter. Even if it's AP, do deliberation with them and ask them questions, make them feel like they're exercising their debate muscle. 

When we had 8 people pull up to a session before we taught them BPs, I made one of them a fake reply speaker once. Basically a 4th person gave a 4 minute speech as a reply speech. When there were 7 people, there was a reply speaker from one side but not the other side, we just worked around with what we had.

b) Another issue is the complications of adjing. This was initially a section under "Inside a Session", but my rant grew longer and longer so I made it a chapter of its own.

## Encouraging Adjing is Complicated

[Link back to the 'Time' subsection if you came from the link there](#time)
### My Story
The debsoc controversy I am the most infamous for is my history with Adjudication.
This was before CUPD 2023, my first tournament. My seniors put up a poll for speakers and adjudicators, and naturally everyone from my batch including me voted for speaking. 
2 weeks before the tournament, there were 4 of us who were still unsorted into the slots we had paid for. Our seniors were getting increasingly frustrated with us telling us, "How have you not decided your roles amongst yourselves yet?". 
As we were all freshers to the debsoc, I expected our seniors to assign roles for us, since most of us hadn't been to a tournament before, but they seemed to avoid that responsibility. (I believe this is another underlying issue with the way we approach tournaments, giving 'freedom' without it really being freedom, and just leaving us clueless since there's no authority to back up a decision.)
The 4 of us continued to remain silent about which 3 would form a team and which one would adj.
In an attempt to reach a decision, I texted, "Who wants to adj?", and nobody responded. 
Anyway my seniors saw it and the next debate session I was ripped apart. I said that since adjing was undesirable for everyone, they should have a fair system to select the adj, possibly spinning a wheel.
I got told off for dissing on adjing and getting defensive (which is valid, I was), and was told that I'd be the adj (who saw this coming am I right). 
I had never been told that judges competed too, so I felt like I was just a bus driver for the real performers who were debaters.
Being a forced adj for CUPD didn't get me to like adjing either.
For those who know me, things changed eventually, and I ended up adjing 3x more debates than I've spoken in.
Anyway, this highlights a couple problems with adjing.

### Adjing Obstacles

1. Adjing is seen as more undesirable than speaking by the vast majority of the circuit, as seen from
- The constant requests on mixidea and 4crossmock where speaker slots have been filled up fast but nobody wants to voluntarily adj.
- The constant adj scarcity in tournaments and begging to OC to waive off adj slots, or begging to juniors to adj.
2. If someone's adjing out of obligation, it's hard to set up a system of rotating adjes to be 'fair' with carrying the burden of adjing. (As you can guess, this also negatively warps the [narrative of adjing](#the-adj-narrative)).
3. Adjing tournaments can disappoint freshers due to a multitude of reasons like 
- They spent most of their time in the debsoc speaking, and aren't trained to do this.
- They're likely to spend the whole tournament as a trainee, and hence
- - speakers scroll their phones during their OA and don't take them seriously, 
- - people go to ask the chair feedback instead of them, and 
- - they feel they have no impact on the tournament because their vote doesn't matter. 
- - They don't get any numerical result from the tournament either.
- Same things for BP except that they do a lot of boring work to track 4 teams, and only have 60 seconds to make a case, so they don't get the thrill of standing and giving a speech either.
- There's so much fun in debate with a teammate, and as an adj you feel lonely. At every room, there won't be any PES friends. 
 - There's no real opportunity to talk to anyone either. You have your lunch during speaker case prep, and speakers get to chill with each other when you're preparing your OA.
 - Adjing is boring and challenging with no real payoff.
 ![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/svJgvW5V/early-in-adjing-obstacles.jpg)
4. At the CUPD that I spoke about, there were 4 teams with seniors, 1 team from us freshers, 1 senior adj, and 4 junior adjes, which shows that my seniors essentially 'used' us freshers to carry the burden of adjing so that they could enjoy the speaking slots that we opened up for them.
5. My seniors believed that freshers should compulsorily adj their first tournament. I think this is a good concept on paper, but the main issues are:
- There are a dozen freshers in their first tournament, it doesn't make sense to make all of them adj.
- The point of the initial tournament is to give juniors an experience so fun and insightful that juniors will want to continue debating and doing tournaments. And even if the grueling work of adjing 'builds character', they may not want to ever do a tournament again.
6. You usually can't go to a tournament as 6 speakers and no adj. So even if one person is a usual designated adj, who's gonna adj and earn this person a speaking slot when they want to speak? 

_One initial solution I had thought of a year ago, was to make people adj once every three or four tournaments._
- _This number was chosen because contingents usually can afford twice or thrice the number of speakers than adjes, and mathematically the ratios match when people switch roles across tournaments._
- _Freshers can speak in their first two tournaments, and this will be enough for them to not quit even if their adjing experience sucks._ 
- _This also distributes adjes evenly among multiple tournaments._
- However, later I realized this was bad for the [narrative of adjing](#the-adj-narrative). (The only way to still execute this is equally say that _speaking_ twice in 3 tourneys is also 'compulsory', but this is too delicate and weird, and one slip-up ruins the narrative of adjing).
6. Freshers can't really adj during round 1 round 2 recruitments because they don't know what to judge, or how to analyze clashes. The thrill of speaking is way more than the thrill of adjing, so to bait them into the debsoc the initially need to speak.
7. How do you get them to switch to adjing if they have gotten used to speaking?


## The Adj Narrative

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

### Characterization

==**It's challenging but necessary to be careful with every word to not propagate a negative narrative of adjing.**==
From the way my CUPD lore went down, it was clear that my bad impression of adjing just became worse. So most variations of 'compulsory' adjing are likely to be destructive. 


The ideal scenario to get them to switch to adjing is that they wanna try something new, try adjing, and end up liking it. The ideal scenario is people voluntarily adj in tournaments and push through all the sad parts. The Debsoc in 2023 was blessed to have multiple people voluntarily passionately adj tournaments, removing one of the biggest burdens of tournaments. I had never seen this phenomenon in my 2 years of debate till then, and slightly hold the belief that this happened due to random chance.


How do we make sure this trend continues?
- Already having the trend is a good start. My seniors lacking adjes, and avoiding adjing themselves pushed the narrative that adjing was undesirable for me. Currently there is a trend of debsoc seniors voluntarily judging, which is nice and makes it look desirable.
- The target audience of people who will like adjing more than speaking, needs to be aware of the full benefits of adjing. What are the reasons these people get into adjing in the first place?
- + I know someone who got into adjing because they were too afraid to speak.
- + I know someone who judges when they're too exhausted to speak.
- + I know people who end up judging all the time because they're late all the time.
- + I know people who equally feel like judging/speaking, and because they're the only one among 7 people who feel that way, they're made a judge.
- + People may feel to pressured to give a speech, and are too used to having no case due to no knowledge of the world, and judging seems more comfortable because you're given the content. (A major reason I prefer judging.)
- + Some more positive reasons to judge are because people like the way their brain is use during judging, and how challenging it is.
- + **The interesting thing about the narrative of freshers early on before they judge, is that judging looks like a position of authority.** Freshers believe that you need to be highly qualified to be a judge, and that being a judge is a sign of you being great (They're unaware that anyone can judge in a tournament). 
- I don't know how exactly to encourage adjing (because if you start outright telling everyone 'adjing is nice, do try it out', it looks like you're a scamster. Anything that is actually good doesn't need explicit endorsement.) 
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/xSwn9pdD/Whats-App-Image-2025-09-09-at-23-10-53.jpg)
- However, I have a few possible [ideas](#elevating-the-judging-experience) on how you might improve a fresher's enjoyment of judging mocks. 
- But what is definitely important, is avoiding discouraging adjing. Members of the debsoc have often made statements which ruin the narrative of adjing (me included), and we need to be careful.

Samuel, my senior, once said this to encourage judging,

"Also, I notice a lot of you love speaking and I couldn't be glader [_sic_] you're all eager to debate. However do note that Adjudication/Judging is equally important for the following reasons:
1) Adjudicating is also a competition in tournaments, and speakers rate you on your Oral Adjudication (OA).
2) It's easier to break (qualify to playoffs), as an adjudicator than a speaker.
3) The prize money for adjes is obscene - 10-20k ez for best adjes at big tournaments.
4) Adjing makes you a better debater, because you analyse the debate from a neutral perspective and have to do all aspects from framing to weighing, making you well rounded.
5) It's a great way to get rep in the circuit and become highly respected. A lot of career adjes are some of the most respected people in the circuit.
All in all, try and balance the both when you come for practice, that way you become a more well rounded debater. Cheers :)"

The way he carefully did it was by knowing that at the time people didn't judge because they hadn't even tried it out, and he was encouraging them to try it out, which was a smart move.
**I think it's very important to inform people that judges also compete at tournaments, because we don't consciously inform this to new recruits, and recruits also never expect that judges compete as well, so they're usually ignorant of this fact. This information makes people care about becoming better judges, and shows that judging is a challenge worth pursuing.** (if new debaters don't know that judges compete, then why would they want to register as an adj at a tournament).

However, a few issues from Sam's text are
- "easier to break" isn't necessarily true, and I'm unsure about the messaging that people should try it because it's easy.
- The judge prize money isn't that accurately portrayed, and that feels like a speculative impact to a lot of people.
- Sam missed out on all the benefits IAs and SAs get. If you want to market judging financially to people, **tell them about how colleges in Bangalore like NLS and Christ pay people, quite ordinary SA level people to come judge for them.** I got 5k once to judge NLS (Even though I have never broken at a tournament) and I was super happy about judging.
- A fundamental issue is that people may wonder why there is even pressure put on them to judge, because if judging is actually fun, everybody should be trying to do it. Maybe people don't think so deep. Luckily this isn't a real problem with Samuel's context of, "making people aware of something they've never tried out", but while trying to convince people to judge, you replicate this text, some nuances may be missed and it might not work out.


### Common Pitfalls

**Trends get pushed in micro ways, and try to avoid being a perpetuator as much as you can** 
- One of my seniors once was coming to a session after a long time, and when I asked them to adj, they replied, "I'm not coming to a session after so long to _adj_".

- Making people judge when they come late seems like a 'punishment'. When they show up as the 7th person, they might say something like, "Aw man, I'm judging today?!", and we might be too tempted to say, "If you want to speak, then come earlier next time", as an effort to make them punctual. 
- Even actions with positive intent can be destructive. Profusely thanking someone for agreeing to your judge can be destructive ("Thank you so so so much for making a huge sacrifice and agreeing to judge my mock/judge for this tournament"), because they further the narrative that adjing is undesirable.
- If you have a strict bar for people to participate in tourneys (inactive people cannot come to tourneys), you might be tempted to lower the bar for someone who wants to adj, saying, "We really need an adj, we'll take you to Bombay with us even if you have been inactive", which further pushes that adjing is undesirable.
- Page 38 and 40 of the book I mentioned earlier, [Empowering University Debate Clubs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAni64_JD4Uu6N00kryFs0j_W7q1Heeb/view) puts it into words better than I ever can. (Page 38 is about the difficult task of getting seniors to judge juniors, which I'd recommend checking out. Here are some very relevant excerpts from page 40.
- - Sometimes societies struggle with finding people willing to judge and opt for a rotating system. This usually enforces an obligation to judge one time per three to four debates. This system is good for egalitarian treatment and makes sure no one feels like they are being pressured into judging too much. In small societies with just a few qualified judges, this system-approach allows for new people to quickly get into judging. The advice would be to ask the good judges to chair the first few months with different new people as wings before going fully into the system to keep the judging level consistent. However, this system can make judging seem like “a chore” to earn “the reward” of debate. It forces people to keep track of how many people have debated and can decrease judging quality if a big pool of novices is involved. A hybrid system of rotating systems (rather informally) and encouraging narratives and activities can prevent the cons of this approach.
> Furthermore, it should be emphasized that judging is just a part of debating and it is a great opportunity to provide feedback to help your friends and fellow debaters improve. Rather than seeing it as an act of service, it should be presented as a given, not to create narratives of judging being a “duty” and debating a “reward”.

Although this is idealistic and nice in principle, it's hard to really implement this and ensure that such narratives are created exactly the way we wish. "Presented as a given" sounds a lot like, "compulsory".

### Elevating The Judging Experience
Adjudication only started to really feel fulfilling to me when I felt the value I was providing.
- I was the sole third year student holding sessions, and I felt valued since sessions couldn't run without me.
- I wasn't a 'useless trainee' judge anymore, but now a chair who people depended on.
- I felt this 'value' when juniors asked me for feedback on getting better. It made me feel like I was the shit, the man.

How do we get inexperienced juniors to enjoy judging though? Since they are not fully qualified to give feedback.
The two scenarios a junior would be judging is 
1. As a panel to a senior chair
2. As a chair, a sole judge, when the senior present decides to speak instead.

I think there are primarily 2 ways to replicate a portion of this feeling that I had, and it's the duty of the senior present to try.
1. **If you're the chair, make the junior feel like their thoughts are heard.** 
2. **If you spoke, ask this junior judge for feedback. Most people don't think of this because they think there's no point of doing this. However, it can still help you to know how an ordinary person would interpret your speech. And it does leagues of improvement in the enjoyment of a junior to judge, because they feel proud about their opinion being valued by a senior. They might say things like, "I don't know how to judge, this is my first time, don't ask me", but get it out of them, saying that you value their words, you value the fact that they sat through your 1 hour yap.**

Speakers rarely feel like they didn't matter, because people pay attention to their words, and their words are talked about in the OA. Trainees however often feel like they didn't matter. Make sure they enjoy judging, and make sure they feel that they're contributing, and they matter. 

_However, I wouldn't recommend getting the fresher to give an OA to everyone because people might follow incorrect advice from them. What I did, was ask this panelist to give their OA privately to me. 
However, if you think you can interrupt their OA and catch them on every mistake or misleading piece of feedback, and prevent harm to the other fresher speakers, then go for public OAs. 
However, interrupting is annoying, and you might make a mental note of their mistakes and tell them later, but in this case you're also quite likely to forget your mental notes._

## Push to come to sessions

The question the debsoc will forever grapple with is, "How do we get people to come to sessions?"
![enter image description here](https://www.davelabowitz.com/wp-content/uploads/Sisyphus-e1557869810488.jpg)

Being strict works in getting people to work at school because you're forced to come anyway. Being strict in the debsoc and causing bad vibes just pushes people to avoid it all.
The stance my seniors adopted in 2022 was one involving fear. Everyone was supposed to vote on the poll (Actually fill a google form because Whatsapp didn't have the poll feature at the time), and DM one of the heads with a very valid reason if they were missing out on that session. 
One time our debate knowledge was tested. And we got shit on for not knowing the full form of THP even after a year in the club. 
When numbers of attendees dropped, we were called to serious meetings where we were yelled at. The constant threat was that if we weren't attending enough sessions, we'd be kicked out of the club. 

At the time I was apathetic about late night online sessions, and I adopted the stance of, "Oh if they want to kick me out so badly, I'm fine getting kicked if they remember to do it".

Fear isn't a great motivator especially when the consequence is the direction they're heading towards anyway. This 'punishment' intuitively doesn't make sense because why would people want to be in a club without enjoying the activity and wanting to participate in the core activity of the club? (The intuitive assumption is that anyone who cares about being in the club would also care enough to attend debates, because that's the point).
By the way, there are a few possible answers to this question actually
1. It's in the back of their mind, and they always think about coming, but they never bring themselves to come. Other things take priority.
2. They want to be in a club for the sake of it, because it's cool. (There are people who get excited over buying debsoc merch even though they don't debate anymore and even feel like even a part of the club). 
![image](https://i.ibb.co/Y929MpB/Screenshot-2025-09-06-162019.png)
3. They have issues on weekdays but not weekends.
4. They want to do tournaments because they are super fun, but don't want to attend sessions because they're not that fun. (Surprisingly a very common scenario I've observed).
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/rKY6GKfn/Whats-App-Image-2025-09-09-at-23-25-35.jpg)

It's hard to really solve these problems, the best you can do is things like Cubbon Park sessions, and also keep the value of sessions high.

- A lot of people, in their head, will feel guilty about coming to debate, because 'they should be studying instead', 'they could have been studying instead'. People always imagine that if they got 2 hours extra in a day, they would spend those hours studying. Even if people actually end up passing the time anyway on their short days, the fantasy of this is enough to deter people from walking to a debate session. 
- Nobody thinks that debating is more productive than studying, regardless of how much debating adds value to your life. Second year onwards, the main reason people would come is because of the community. People should be _tempted_ to come debate. 
- The only reason college students do anything besides studies, is when something feels fun, or if it's what people picturized themselves doing in their college life. People may come to debate sessions because it helps them pursue their dream of, "having a fun college life", the way that people hang out with their friends regardless of their academic commitments.

The activity of the debsoc should be kept fresh in the minds of even the people who don't come to debate. Just seeing a poll everyday doesn't give even me a feel of the club being lively, and debating.
Share the motion on the WhatsApp group (not the Sessions group because that prevents free-flowing conversation since people cannot reply to it), share random fun pictures of the people at the session, maybe share the names of the people at the session if there are quite a few people. It really makes people feel the fear of missing out, the feel that there's something thriving which other people are enjoying, which they are not a part of.

One thing that Akshat Saxena once told me was, to ignite passion in the juniors, the seniors must also show their passion and how debate obsessed they are. This shows that debate is something people find fun enough, valuable enough, to spend their time in, even when they have other priorities. Seeing other people with an opinion of debate being valuable makes juniors feel like the right opinion, the normal opinion, the socially validated opinion is to also enjoy debate. On the flip side seniors avoiding sessions pushes the narrative that, "Debate is something everyone stops eventually", and making something feel temporary gives less reason for a junior to invest time and energy to work towards a long-term debate goal.

Inertia is huge and letting people go long without debating can be detrimental. People get comfortable with patterns and routines. Try to have some debate scene in vacations, like online sessions or Cubbon park, and try to start debating the moment a new academic semester starts. The first 2 weeks are crucial to break the inertia, because once assignments start rolling in, it's really hard to break the routine of 'not debating'. On the flip side if people have started debating every Tuesday and Wednesday, people usually continue it.

If you have successfully made juniors believe that tournaments are fun as hell, and if you really need an external motivator to get people to come to sessions, then tournaments work well as your carrot. Only allowing people who consistently show up is the only real incentive, one of the few bits of leverage you have (well I suppose you can gatekeep Debsoc merchandise too for only the active debaters lol). This also makes the reward feel valuable to someone since they earned it, they were chosen for this slot because of their dedication to the soc. As long as this threat is followed upon, it remains as an incentive since tournaments are constant through the year, and being prevented from one tournament isn't permanent because you can earn your reward for the next tournament.
The issue is that this makes Debsoc sessions look like a chore, but at least people will come to a session and then remember how fun sessions are. (Like some people who experience the thrill of solving an academic question, yet still procrastinate starting to solve the questions). It also makes people feel like they're working towards something, every session is bringing them closer to a tournament.

(We did this occasionally and made it such that if you didn't qualify for a tournament but really wanted to come, you could pay out of your own pocket. The Debsoc didn't owe you money because you weren't really a contributing member to the soc, you didn't assist in its activity through sessions.)

## Informal recruitments

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

During recruitments, a lot of recruits show up with their friends. Sometimes these friends are unsure if they're even allowed. Encourage these friends to stay and watch/participate as a swing(if they don't want to join the club)/chill. People have fun engaging in an activity like debating, alongside or against their friends. Friends often egg each other on to come to Debsoc too.
A major reason people find it difficult to come to sessions after classes is if they'd rather spend that time with their friend, and bringing the friend along solves that issue.

Spectating should be counted as interest even for regular recruitments, because people are investing their time and exercising their debate muscle. Heck, even walking down to the basement is an indicator of interest.
Every year there are people initially anxious about speaking in front of strangers. **Let them know** that spectating is an option, instead of putting the responsibility on them to build up the courage to ask you if they can spectate. A lot of spectators do get converted into debaters, and these people would have been missed out on if they only had the option to debate or not.

Informal recruitments, also known as lateral entry, is the entry of people into the debate society even after official recruitments have concluded. With round 1, round 2, round 3, and usually the exams of seniors almost immediately after that, recruitments usually conclude right at the end of the shared odd semester semester (the portion that's shared between seniors and the first sem of juniors). 


#### What causes the need of informal recruitments?

- A lot of people might not have heard of the debsoc at the start of recruitments, or even if they have, they may not have felt that it was a good club worth pursuing. They may have been too wrapped up with the start of college and now have clarity on how they want to pursue clubs.
- Most such people get interested in the debsoc because their friend sings praises of the debsoc.
- If these people are made to wait until the official recruitments next year, it might be too late to hook them into debating (because a majority of freshers drop out of the club when the academic grind steepens in the 3rd sem). Or because by the next sem, their friend drops out and they aren't invested enough into debating to care to continue.

#### What are the benefits of informal recruitments?
- It lessens the load on the swarm of recruitments the next year.
- **It really helps with the activity of the soc the next sem.** Even if people haven't entirely dropped out of the club yet, hardly 10% of the people show up to 1 session a week by the time the even semester rolls around. At that point the atmosphere really gets subdued if there are only 3 people at an average session. **At a time like this, fresh blood is crucial to rejuvenate the soc.** (Yes the Debsoc is a big vampire). You get to do full APs again, you get to keep activity going and make the people on Whatsapp feel like they're missing out, and you prevent the full death of the club. 
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/RGVgZkcN/Whats-App-Image-2025-09-10-at-00-11-01.jpg)
- If the average debate tenure of people is 8 months, then when you don't have your old recruits to help you conduct the next recruitments, you'll usually at least have these people to help you. 
- Even if they're temporary and you think they'll leave soon (because they didn't care enough to come to the actual recruitments), their help in keeping the society alive is valuable to keep the flow of the other members going.


#### How do we usually carry out informal recruitments?
- (What we usually don't do is inform people that this is even possible, and hence we only get a small number of people who push their message through their friends, or get their hands on the contact number of the clubhead and pester them). This is enormous work on them, and it should be way easier than this for someone to opt in. Most people don't even think this is possible because the natural assumption of an ignorant first year is that people only get recruited during recruitments, so even if they want to reach out, they don't because they don't see the point of the attempt. 
- Please be one step better than us and announce to everyone that their friends can get recruited into the soc. **Being proactive instead of reactive is pretty much the theme of this document.**
- This doesn't require a whole dedicated phase of recruitments because there won't be that many people to cater to. 
- We still need to make sure people feel like they earned their way into the club.
- I usually set the bar of attendance to be like 5 sessions, and once they reach that, they get into Shenanigans.
- People like Harikeshav, Nahush, Gokul, Aditya Chaitanya, started off by spectating debates and then proceeding to debate themselves. I believe spectating should be counted as attendance (like I've said previously).
- A few people who undergo informal recruitments are the people who barely missed out in round 3, who still expressed desire to join when I reached out to them. I keep the bar a little lower for them. I'm glad to see many of them are still debating today, 6 months later, and did NALSAR, like Shubhangi, Akshay Gudur, and Akshith.


## Tournaments

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The major differences between tournaments and mocks are:
stakes, dedicated days for debate, and the increased depth and breadth of the community (More time with more friends)

Aaaaaand the money.

### Freeloaders

By freeloaders I mean people who don't participate in the debsoc much, yet want to join reimbursements.
For quite a few years, the debsoc has tried to prevent freeloaders, but sometimes we've found it hard to say no to people. 


When the debsoc tries to send a lot of people to a tournament and asks for reimbursements, the management sometimes makes it an issue and asks the debsoc to cut names. 
Sometimes while applying for reimbursements, we try to limit people in the application because we fear that if we initially have too many people, instead of telling us to cut people, they might reject reimbursement for the tournament entirely (ghost the mail). Sometimes they reject tournaments if you've gone to other tournaments recently.
I don't have experience communicating between students and the management, so I can't really tell how to work with the management.

Basically, tournament reimbursement slots are kind of limited. Every slot is hard earned by the clubheads or whoever communicates to the management. 

You might want to use tournaments to incentivize people to come to sessions. Whatever stance you take on 'freeloaders,' the hardest part is sticking to it.
It's awkward to tell friends, to tell people you know, that they don't meet the bar to attain reimbursement for the tournament. But standing your ground sets a precedent for the future that your actions are in line with your words, and this affects how seriously your future words are taken as well.

If it's an official rule you will publicize, make sure you know the answers to all the clauses. 
What if someone was active earlier but is inactive now? What if there's a tournament with only a few interested people, so slots aren't really limited then, can this person benefit from reimbursement? What if this person met the bar to go to previous tournaments yet isn't active enough for this one? What if someone interacts on the group and helps the community, but doesn't debate at sessions? What if the person is a skilled debater and is your best chance at getting a title?

### Tournament Registration

The first time you forward a tournament advertisement post to freshers, make sure to state that they shouldn't click on the google form link and register by themselves (a common honest mistake otherwise). 

For their first tourney, most freshers won't know each other, and so you might be left with 4 people with no teammate preference. In this case it makes sense to assign teams yourself. In future tournaments people will have friends they want to do tourneys with, and will sign up as pairs/trios. 
What we sometimes do is send a poll with a speaker option, adjudicator option, and a no option. I think this system is flawed for reasons I said in my [adj rant](#my-story), and maybe it would be better to just ask for participants, and decide the speaker-adj split later. This split is awkward for the reasons I mentioned in [my story](#my-story), but unless you're able to get an adj waiver or have enough voluntary adjes in the soc, you're going to have to deal with this issue somehow.

Early reg is ideal but it's often really hard because there are so many steps like people asking their parents, reimbursement mails, etc.
Since reimbursement gets confirmed very late (often after the tournament), we usually tell people, "There's a chance of reimbursement, but no guarantee, so register only if you can handle no reimbursement". 

It's absolutely necessary to collect money from everybody _**before**_ paying the sum total to the tournament organizing committee. 
- Otherwise, someone might drop out due to unforeseen reasons after you've already paid their share, and there's no way to really get your money back from them. 
- - You have to struggle to find a replacement which is rarely possible because everyone interested will already have registered. 
- If someone has paid you already, they're less likely to drop out because the money has already been spent. 

### Tournament Briefing
Freshers are often intimidated at their first tournament, due to being unaware of the place, unaware of the system, unaware of Tabbycat, etc, and look for a senior to guide them through the weekend.

Debate tournaments have a stark difference between expectations and reality for anyone new to them. If you don't educate juniors on the tournament experience, then
- They might reach home later than they told their parents to expect them.
- They might delay food expecting a break, and then miss out on eating food at all, if you don't tell them the strategic time to eat food.
- There are a lot of possible logistic issues like all members of a team filling feedback, trainees being confused about filling the ballot, a bunch of other Tabbycat issues like navigating on your private url, different forms of check-in, etc.
- They might expect the tournament to provide food so they won't have made their own food plans like lunch boxes.

One briefing session before their first tournament, talking about the logistics, equity, and anything else, can go a long way. It's also nice to drive hard the point that the experience, the learning, and the fun matter far more than points. 

The biggest difference between expectations and reality of course, is that juniors are used to interschool science quizzes where most people score high. And they won't have really comprehended that this is a national level tournament with people years elder to them.
Every novice initially assumes that they'll only face novices in the tournament, and get a rude awakening. 

Tournaments are very draining physically, mentally, and emotionally. Juniors usually don't know how likely it is to go back home with 0 points or 1 point. This has happened multiple times before and has left them absolutely devastated (to be fair it's happened in APs). I think the egos of juniors are in need of a warning of this tragedy.
I believed that it was better to make them prepared for this possibility instead of being blindly optimistic about their results. However this is something particular to my beliefs and the way I see the world, so I'm unsure if it's better to act like your expectations for them are low, or high. If your expectations are high, people will feel like their performance was far lower than what it should have been, and that they disappointed you. But if your expectations are low then it could affect their self-esteem from the start if their mentor has no hope in them.

### Tournament Spirits
Due to different rooms having different end times, it's hard to execute this, but do try to get everyone to congregate at a designated spot after every round to chill together. Without a contingent it's easy for people to feel lost and lonely.
I've talked [before](#adjing-obstacles) about how judges feel extremely lonely at tournaments. Meeting them, asking about their round, and asking about how they felt they did, is doubly as important for judges who yearn for someone to listen to them (especially since speakers rarely do). 

In groups that form naturally, a few juniors are often left out of the conversation. Seniors usually know each other and have easy conversation, whereas juniors find it difficult to barge in, and hence feel left out. Seniors intentionally involving every junior into conversation goes a long way. Simply acknowledging their existence goes a long way. (I know I've had tournaments where I felt invisible and like my presence didn't matter). 

If the disappointment of participants builds up after every round, they may never want to do a tournament (or even debate) again. Try to give them good experiences, which can be done in a myriad of ways like taking fun pictures, dropping lore (Debate lore or even PES lore), asking them to drop their lore, playing card games, roaming around the campus or the city. 

Also I find conditional extra hyped stakes like, "If you don't break, you're kicked from the soc," to be in bad taste. Even if it's obvious as a joke, it drives the narrative that the seniors have expectations on you, and if you don't meet them, you're a disappointment. (I'm typing this fresh as a junior randomly texted me saying they're sorry for disappointing me (It appears I wasn't successful in telling them enough that results don't matter to me)).

We've had traditions like, "the tab topper at this tournament will be given[^2] brownies", but I don't know how far that really motivates people's performance, or how it impacts their emotions post the tournament when they achieve it and when they don't.
Sure, it does feel necessary to reward the ones who put effort, and the common way to measure effort put in is by the output, but these people already get enough dopamine hits in my opinion.

[^2]: These people sometimes didn't even received their brownies lmao

#### Breaks

![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/JwzPPn3J/novice-speaker.jpg)
Breaks are where emotional turbulence is at a high since it's the culmination of the stakes across the whole tournament. People get starkly divided into the elated and the crestfallen. 

Congratulating your friends who broke is a great display of contingent spirit. It's great to be proud because we've all trained together and supported each other on the journey of debate.

The people who haven't broken, both the people who narrowly missed out or people who aren't even close, feel a tinge of sadness amid this celebration. It's important for a senior to be aware and tend to these people providing reassurance and comfort. People feel really low after tourneys especially since in their head, the score next to their team is the most objective measurement of their skill. It sucks to have worked so hard but still be graded terribly.

A few people including me believe glorifying the speaker score is useless and does more harm than good. Like I've said in [Feedback](#feedback), speaker scores are something people believe to be an accurate measurement, but in reality fluctuate to the point where they're unreliable. The main insight people derive from a speaker score is who was the superior teammate and who was the inferior teammate. Regular scores can be blamed on the 'team's case' or the 'team's synergy', but the speaker score feels especially harsh because the blame is on you. 


Glorifying one person's speaker score for being the best speaker is kinda an insult to their teammate. 
Pragmatically, the good that you can claim comes out of this is that, "the speaker feels honored for the work they've done", and, "people get inspired to be like them". But usually the speaker feels happy enough with whatever other result they have already achieved. If you really want to do this, you can do this in private to them. Other people are also 'inspired enough' usually to debate, glorifying someone else is unlikely to result in extra effort from them, and can actually result in them feeling even worse about themselves. Sure, juniors aren't snowflakes, but there's no real point in hurting their self-esteem which is already bruised from the tournament. It's normal for humans to feel sad when it comes to something they care about.

For so long I had felt jealous of people being congratulated, but when I and my teammate were on the receiving side, we didn't really find the glorification to be that special, it didn't have an actual impact on our actual happiness, and I felt pity for the ones on the other side.

### Online Tournaments

The target audience for online tournaments is people in it solely for the debate grind over the fun of the tournament experience. Hence, as time goes on, the only people who do them are the hardcore ones.

Initially though, online tournaments are popular with juniors who want to do a tournament without investing 3k rupees.
I wouldn't want juniors to start with an online tournament with no fun, and make them believe that all debate tournaments are like this.
So if you end up sending them to an online tournament before an offline one, try to make it as offline as possible.
The most memorable online tournament for me has been SBS in early 2024. We all met up together offline on both days, and debated together, ate together, dropped lore together, and had a fun time (primarily because of Samuel the jester). 

#### Online Tournament Logistics

PES wifi sometimes randomly blocks discord and randomly unblocks discord. Sometimes even when discord is unblocked, voice calls on discord are blocked (but voice calls on Google Meet aren't blocked). So try to test everyone's systems first.

The major spots at PES with accessible wifi are the GJB library, the GJB cafeteria, and the 13th floor at PES. (When our clubhead was the CCBD head, we once sat in the CCBD lab and debated).
The places you can debate in GJB library are the small brainstorming rooms, but unfortunately only one team can fit in one of these rooms at a time (because otherwise two teams may talk over each other). Since you can't get together as a contingent, I wouldn't recommend this. Moreover, this place isn't open on Sundays.

The GJB cafeteria has like 3 power sockets. I'd recommend this only as a last resort, and not for a long duration either. It's usually deserted on Saturdays and Sundays, and you can enter and turn on the lights yourself. 

What I find to be the best place is the 13th floor of B block (heavy bias tbh). Debating in the indoors section usually isn't feasible because there are people you'll disturb, or it's locked. There are 3 sections outdoors; the cafeteria, the place next to the cafeteria on the other side of the throne, and a spot with wide long tables on the opposite side of 13th floor (next to the faculty zone, on the other side of the silent room). 
These are fairly empty on Saturday and Sunday. AND ALL OF THEM HAVE MULTIPLE POWER SOCKETS!!

How to access this place:

(Obviously talk to the security in Kannada)
Security guards might tell you that it's closed when you enter B block. Reply to this saying that you're not going inside, you'll just be outdoors. 
If they say that it's restricted, tell them that the Debate Club is doing an online competition here, just like they have been doing for the last 2 years.  
If all else fails, say that you know a security guard named Shankar. If Shankar is there, tell him that you're the kids of Srijan. 😂😂

However they'll usually let you in without asking any questions. Just don't make sure a boy and a girl enter together, always go in larger groups or one by one.

You're allowed to order food to PES, collect it at the main gate, bring it up to 13th floor and eat there. 


#### Cafe Down The Alley


This used to be our regular post session hangout spot back in 2023, 
but the last time I went here was after the online tournament Mukhtalif.

Online tournaments can be severely lacking in fun, and it was hard for me to engage people in conversation post their debates, because I was busy preparing and giving my OAs. People were sad and everyone wanted to quit before round 5.
I reached out to shenanigans 5.0, and they gave me the idea of chilling at Cafe Down The Alley. (We still proceeded to quit round 5 lol)

This was a great idea because it had food and great games. 
Some people played Chess, sometimes people played Uno (I'll hate Debsoc Uno till my dying day because everyone debates over the rules), and we played Jenga, the greatest group game there (because it's so fun for everyone to experience people shaking the tower of blocks). 

The food is on the pricier side and they unfortunately seem to no longer have a discount for PES students.

I like how it's still able to simulate the fun chill vibe of acco at offline tournaments. It also has the novelty that makes it feel like we're going out instead of staying at PES.

## Community

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Write about inbreeding somewhere in some other section. Novice crossmocks don't add that much value. Also talk about recordings on Youtue and how these can add as much value as high level crossmocks.
Maybe talk about doing speeches and then seeing how the people in the recording did it. 

### Cubbon Park
Holding a couple Cubbon Park Sessions in a year is a Debsoc tradition.
Cubbon vibes are unattainable on regular days at PES. Cubbon sessions have way more turnout also because more of Bangalore lives closer to Cubbon Park than PES, and have more free time on the weekends.
Cubbon Park is usually scheduled for a Saturday or Sunday. One time when people were split between Saturday and Sunday, we did both, but that was too exhausting.
As I mention later, the opportunities for Cubbon Park sessions are rare and you should grab them if you want them. Vacation time may seem ideal but you're bound to miss out on hostelites who go home. Holding them a few times a year keeps them accessible to everyone.

Every Cubbon, there have been 2 groups of people who show up to Cubbon sessions: people who want to debate, and people who want to play. The needs of one group get compromised. We usually end up playing eventually anyway, but half the time we precede this playing with a debate.
We've played kabaddi, dog and the bone, mafia, and card games.

The most difficult part of Cubbon has been the arrival. For people's first Cubbon session, they won't know the usual debsoc spot. Clear instructions like, "Get off at BR Ambedkar station" are crucial because most people assume that the proximate station is Cubbon Park. The best landmark, more than the dog park, is the Library, because it's a building that can be seen from afar. Even with all these instructions, people get lost all the time because it's Cubbon. Session delay at PES is nothing compared to Cubbon sessions. People come late because it's a weekend too. Deciding when to start debate/activity, and how long you're ready to wait, is crucial to minimize the frustration of people who come with certain expectations and time constraints. (People often feel frustrated when they put effort to come early but no activity starts until the latecomers show up). 


### Beyond The Debates

Circles get formed in hangouts quite often. These circles can be both physical with body posture, and metaphysical, with one new or rare fresher. People direct their conversation towards their friends, and people on the outside find it awkward to join a conversation among people who know each other like this.
It can be really impactful to put extra effort to talk to everyone so that they don't feel like they're part of an 'outgroup'.

![enter image description here](https://www.utoronto.ca/sites/default/files/picpath/2015-12-02-feeling-alone.jpg)
---

A good way to make people feel valued is to remember them by their name, call them by their name, make some reference to a thing they had said on a previous day, etc. It makes them feel less like they're invisible and more like they had some impact on the people of debsoc.

---

**It's great to talk about how you went through the same struggles,** had a love-hate relationship with debate, how your confidence oscillated, how you always forgot impacting, how you used to fumble glorification, narrative, and THR motions too. This empathy is great for them to feel normal and less shit about themselves. We don't always consciously do this, but we should proactively try to tell them how we relate to the hardships they're going through now.

---

By the end of a year, the most rigorous debaters are the ones for whom debate friends are their closest friends. Other people usually hangout with their own friends in the evening or on weekends, but these people have their debate friends at the forefront of their brain. 
- Some of these people are the ones who have shifted from their regular friends group, to having debsoc as their primary friends group, in various ways. (PES changes sections, friends don't consistently meet, or people change their short break routine, but Debsoc sessions consistently happen and you constantly meet these people.) 
- Some of these people are the ones who were unable to form many friends at college to begin with. Either they didn't actively talk to people, or they didn't have people who actively talked to them, or they didn't have much to talk about.
- - At debsoc, these people have seniors who actively talk to them. They actively get used to speaking (at least for 7 minutes a day), and there is already content to discuss during post-debate relaxation.
- This is perhaps the club's most beautiful legacy: for years, it has offered a community and friendship to members who yearn for it.

### Teaching debate
For the love of God, there are better motions than THW legalize weed to use as an example when teaching debate. 
However, when asked to pick a random motion to demonstrate a concept, this is the first motion that comes to mind. (Please have more relevant motions at hand before you start a matter session, it makes a huge difference in the illustration clarity of the lesson).
- Most freshers don't know about the system of the black market, or the psychologies of druggies, so a drug debate can feel disconnected.
- So when you teach mech and impacting it, it doesn't feel as real. If you used a parenting motion, children could easily understand mech and impacting when they relate to it.
- Even flipping is easy to understand in a parenting motion, saying that constant reminders to study make you less studious.

The counter arguments I've heard about this are
- It's short and sweet, that's why it comes to mind easily.
- It's more enticing and an "oooooo" topic.
- It's cool to blow people's minds when you make a gov case, cuz they're used to dissing on weed.
- It's a cool demonstration of a flip, saying that banning it makes it worse. 
- "If the first motion I encounter in the soc is something dry like parents and education I might leave"

which are fair, so decide what you feel.

If you have the time and the bandwidth, a great time to teach debate was when only one person shows up to a session but you don't feel like cancelling the session and sending them away. 
What's great about this is that you can make the lesson personalized, understand their thinking process, and tune it precisely. From what I've seen, this has the most direct impact on their approach to debates as a whole, more than giving them advice post a debate.
It's also low stakes practice for you to conduct a matter session in the future. 
It's not unfair that they got access to this personalized coaching and others didn't, because they're the ones that showed up.

What I would do is make up a tangible motion they would understand, like, "This House Would Change PES timings", or, "THW put effort to get a girlfriend", and ask questions to direct them in a certain way. Some other times, I would initially start some random conversation with them about their interests, find out something like them being a volunteer at Aatmatrisha, and then make up a more specific motion like, "THW be a volunteer at Aatmatrisha".
Sometimes after this thorough discussion of their case, I got them to give a speech and see the effects of the deep prep on their confidence and speech quality (It felt really fulfilling for me to watch this as well).

This session also helped me give people the individual attention that I've talked about in earlier chapters.


---
Narrative motions are incredibly complicated for debaters to wrap their head around. Everyone gets carried away and believes that you should prove the narrative to be right or wrong, rather than proving the effects of the narrative to be beneficial or harmful. 

And it's extremely difficult to distinguish the two in most narrative motions, because people have such strong biases. 
For example, "This house regrets the narrative that going to a prestigious university is the key to success", people will definitely argue about whether it is possible to succeed without a university etc. And it's hard to differentiate that from believing in it. Because, in the heads of juniors, people who go to prestigious universities believe in the narrative, and people who don't, don't believe in the narrative, so there's no difference.

So one beautiful motion I came across recently, is:
This house regrets the dominant portrayal of long-distance relationships as doomed to fail.

Here it's quite easy to explain that the narrative could be either right or wrong, but that doesn't matter. It's also quite evident that people who believe the narrative, are going to give up on what could have been a successful relationship. Narratives affecting hope affecting actions is something that can clearly be mechanized from this motion.

### Pranks
My rule of thumb was to not play pranks in the initial days because it erodes trust in the club and its seniors. I abhor pranks like, "You won't get in to debsoc," during recruitment time. I didn't want recruits to associate a feeling of anxiety with the debsoc. Freshers who have only confusion when it comes to PES and how things work at PES, are more intimidated than one would expect.
Light fun might also ruin the experience of a few people. But if you can get people smiling and laughing out of it, convert it into lore, or talk about how you went through the same thing (like the prank to make people wear formals in their first tournament), then it can be beneficial.



### The damn PES timetable

There are different types of differences in the timetables. 
1. The daily timing which is different for B. Tech and non B.Tech. This is so annoying because if one branch has a majority of people, the minority gets too late for session prep time, or too early (they just leave for home). This causes many of the minority to quit debating. 
![enter image description here](https://i.ibb.co/Fqdq4S84/Screenshot-2025-09-06-164009.png)
And the worst part is that the only way to solve this is to have enough seniors from the minority branch (which won't be the case if many of the minority quit debating the year before), so this is a perpetuating cycle. 
Allowing people to join sessions late does mitigate this, but this is really hard to pull off efficiently and I don't know how to go about it. You can't always make the latecomers adj. (Refer the section where I spoke about [making latecomers adj](#common-pitfalls))
2. The weekly timing which gives different people different sets of half days. This further distributes the available recruits into different days. What we usually do is take a poll at the start of the semester asking for people to announce their half days, and then choose like 3 days out of these in a week to hold debates. This calculation involves somehow balancing 'maximization of people', and also, 'making sure every recruit has at least one day a week they can debate'.
3. The alternate exam timing. A significant portion of the semester is taken up by exams, and different branches have it on different weeks. Seniors usually have it together, which makes juniors sit idle and prevents any debate activity that week. When juniors have exams, the available seniors also sit idle. This is often severely underestimated in plan making. If you want to conduct an event like a matter session or a Cubbon session, try to conduct it as soon as possible even if not all factors seem favorable to you. Don't hope to get a better opportunity later because that is way unlikelier than you think. The window of opportunity is limited.
~~At least thank god you're not living in 2022-2023 where everyone had 5 ISAs, one ISA every 3 weeks, 2 different weeks for seniors and juniors, so there were only 5 weeks in a sem to debate.~~



### WhatsApp
Allowing them to text whatever they want, and making them feel comfortable, is a great way to facilitate juniors to bond together, get connected to the community, and engage more with the club. (Equity rules can still apply, that's up to the equity community, I will not speak about it). 
However, this spam of topics unrelated to debate, causes quite a few people to mute the group. 
The issue with people reaching the point where they mute the group, is that they miss out on the occasional important message which comes through. 
Our solution to appease both the yappers and the muters, was to create a new group for Sessions (and utilize the Announcements channel on the Community). 
The polls for every session were posted on this group, and these polls included the options of 2 pm, 4 pm, and No. The group had given the permission to text for admins only, and the admins were all the seniors who had expressed interest in conducting sessions. The polls needed to be shared a day in advance so that people could plan well.
The Announcements channel was for important announcements major documents like the manual. The messages here needed to be minimized so that people could search up quickly. 

Share the motion on the non Sessions group so that people can randomly discuss the motion replying to it (because it takes effort for people to switch groups to talk about a motion, but it's easier to reply to a message above). The only people who would be able to reply to it on Sessions, are seniors with texting permissions, which leads to spam.

In my opinion, even all queries and answers to queries about the session should be on Shenanigans to minimize spam in Sessions. People have different tipping points when it comes to muting, and we don't want people to mute the Sessions group (even if they are on the fence about even engaging). 
Spam by seniors happens often due to accidents, and as long as you realize, cut it out, and redirect it to shenanigans quickly, you won't be reaching anyone's muting tipping points.


PES clubs often tell juniors to market events on every group they are a part of.
The default stance assumed by juniors is that you can send anything you want (especially once the group transitions into random spam). Pre-2023, the Debsoc group was for formal messages only. In 2024, everything was allowed, except for marketing posts from other clubs. This was rather odd, because what makes us find some spam okay but other spam as spam? 
(The cause of this decision was the Debsoc getting pissed by MUN marketing one day, but we couldn't announce that we were banning mun posts, so we said we were banning all posts). 

I think this was rather dumb, 
- especially since the Debsoc desires to do marketing in other groups later. It makes us look hypocritical and shitty when the Debsoc markets itself in a Write Angle group but doesn't allow Write Angle events to be marketed in the Debsoc group. 
- We should be able to tolerate MUN marketing. Most people who have been recruited into Debsoc are loyal enough to not leave anyway. A little bit of MUN marketing won't convince them, and we shouldn't show our fragile egos by saying, "Don't join, MUN is trash".
- If someone is actually destined for MUNsoc, then it's evil of us to prevent MUNsoc marketing from reaching them for the sake of keeping them in our club. We are then basically the witch who keeps Rapunzel locked in a tower to prevent her from leaving and following her destiny, just so that we can extract more value out of her and her hair.

####  More on our approach to MUN as a whole

Since quite a few people try out both clubs, it's unwise to alienate MUN people. 
![image](https://i.ibb.co/rfNNY5sw/debsocmunsoc.png)
Across the year, a few people do switch from debsoc to munsoc, and munsoc to debsoc. This happens naturally and you don't have much power to prevent this by directly targeting MUN. There's no guarantee that your effort will bear fruit instead of backfiring.
It's more dignified to just take the high road. As mentioned earlier, any insults at MUN are unlikely to be persuasive to anyone who's interested in MUN. 

There's no real benefit, but harm still does arise of this action. Even people who never even cared about MUN, will still see the debsoc spewing hate, and think worse of the debsoc. I'd lose respect for a debsoc member who needed to hate on MUN to make debate look valuable.

## The Glorious Unicorn

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

The ultimate stage, the final form of a junior, isn't when they pass a certain skill level. It's an identity shift.
**It's when they see themselves as a debater.**

They believe, "Debsoc is my club". They know, "Debating is what I _do_". Their friends think, "Debating is all they do".

Seeing debate as central to their identity, means that they will forever exhibit soc loyalty. They've reached the point of no return. They will come to sessions because that is what they were meant to do. They were born to pursue this activity.

When you see signs of this in a junior, you know you've done it. It's the greatest success. Regardless of their skill level, if they've reached this perspective, you've truly transformed their life.

It's not easy or quick. For 2 years I didn’t feel like a true debater. In my head, my seniors were the ones who were debaters.

But to my surprise, I see signs of this in a few first years. I see them talking about the club in such a possessive way. I see Debsoc being such a natural part of their weekly routine. They talk about how they see themselves debating in the future. It's lovely.

When something is a part of your identity, you don't feel like you're making an effort to change yourself, because you already have this as your natural state.

Everything the soc does, is in hopes of leading juniors up to this stage. And it feels truly wonderful when it manifests, when you spot this beautiful unicorn.

I hope everything so far has been able to empower you with ideas and vision to tackle challenges that will arise.

Carrying out any of this is easier said than done. Every bit of it takes Herculean effort, and not all effort even translates into success. But you are Hercules. You are my heroes.



> If you reached all the way here, I admire your effort and commitment to the Debsoc. The determination and the attention span you possess to read my ginormous Yap.  
> Thank you for giving me a voice.

41. This house, as the boxer, W agree to fight Jake Paul

You are a retired professional boxer, renowned for an illustrious career and regarded as one of the sport’s greats.

43. This house opposes the rise of pro-immigration policies in developed states with aging populations

An aging population refers to a demographic shift where there are more elderly individuals (often 65 years and older) compared to those who belong in the younger demographic, often because of longer life expectancies and declining birth rates.

59. This house would program the robots to hide the existence of past human life on Earth

It is far into the future. Earth is no longer habitable for life, and the human race on Earth is about to be extinguished. However, we have mastered many advanced technologies, including far space travel. We are sending thousands of human embryos frozen in artificial wombs to a distant, liveable planet. Accompanying them will be robots who are comprehensively programmed to develop, raise, protect, and educate these “New Children” once they reach the new planet.

60. As opposed to financing green energy start-ups, this house believes that states should financially incentivize existing fossil fuel companies' transition into green energy.
 

61. This house believes that budding creators of books and tv/movie series should follow the general wishes of fans when creating the series instead of pursuing their own creative desires (eg. Harry getting together with Ginny instead of Hermione in the Harry Potter series as per what the majority of fans wanted)


62. This house, as Harry Potter, would have used The Imperius Curse on Voldemort and control him to do good for the society

Harry Potter is a wizard who lives in magical land. Voldemort is the most powerful evil wizard, who has previously been responsible for the deaths of Harry's parents and many other witches and wizards. The Imperius Curse makes someone a puppet, under the complete control of the wielder of the curse. It is similar to being subjected to hypnosis, but of course magical and therefore more powerful.


63. This house supports the rise of true crime entertainment

67. This house opposes the creation of child-targeted social media

Infoslide: Child-targeted branches of social media are becoming a common project for many companies. Platforms like YouTube Kids already exist whereas Instagram Kids is a proposed project of Facebook. These are made with the intention of promoting more consumption and usage of social media while providing a safer space for younger children.


68. This house prefers a world with memory erasure technology.

Infoslide

A “memory erasure machine” is a device that is capable of removing specific memories in people’s brains in a manner that is medically safe.

69. This House Would upload their consciousness to the cloud at the point of death

Uploading one's consciousness to the cloud refers to the process of transferring a person's mind, thoughts, and identity into a digital space, allowing them to exist as a non-physical entity. Individuals who undergo this process lose all physical capabilities, including sensation and mobility, but can continue to think, communicate, and interact with the living through digital interfaces. This digital existence is persistent as long as the system supporting it remains functional and as long as others choose to engage with it.
